[Advanced Client API]: #advanced-client-api


In this chapter, we're going to take a deep dive into how the client API works. We're going to show mostly C# code examples, but the 
same concepts apply to any of the RavenDB client APIs, regardless of platform, with minor changes needed to make things applicable.

There are still some concepts that we haven't gotten around to (clustering or indexing, for example), which will be covered in 
their own chapters. But the client API is rich and has a lot of useful functionality on its own, quite aside from the server-side behavior. 

We already looked into the document store and the document session, the basic building blocks of CRUD in RavenDB. But in this chapter, we're going to look beyond the obvious and into the more advanced features. 

One thing we'll _not_ talk about in this chapter is querying.
We'll cover that extensively in Chapter 9, so let's keep it there. You already know the basics of 
querying in RavenDB, but there's a _lot_ more power for you to discover.

This chapter is going to contain a large number of code examples, and it will discuss the nitty-gritty details of using the client. It's divided into 
brief sections each dealing with a specific feature or behavior. I suggest reading this over to note the capabilities of RavenDB 
and coming back to it as needed in your application.

For the rest of this chapter, we'll use the classes shown in Listing 4.1 as our model, using a simplified help desk as our example. 

```{caption="Simplified Help Desk sample model" .cs}
public class Customer
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class SupportCall
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string CustomerId { get; set; }
    public DateTime Started { get;set; }
    public DateTime? Ended { get;set; }
    public string Issue { get; set; }
    public int Votes { get; set; }
    public List<string> Comments { get; set; }
}
```

### Writing documents

Writing documents in RavenDB is easy, as we saw in ["Zero to RavenDB"](#zero-to-ravendb).
If we want to create a new support call, we can use the code in Listing 4.2 to do so.

```{caption="Creating a new support call using the session" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var call = new SupportCall
    {
        Started = DateTime.UtcNow,
        Issue = customerIssue,
        CustomerId = customerId
    };
    session.Store(call);
    session.SaveChanges();
}
```

This is the basic behavior of RavenDB and how you would typically work with saving data. But there are lot of additional things that we can do when
writing data. For example, let's say the user might have sent us some screenshots that we want to include in the support call. 

#### Working with attachments

You can add attachments to a RavenDB document to store binary data related to that document. Let's assume the user sent us a screenshot
of the problem along with the call. Listing 4.3 shows how we can store and retrieve the attachments.

```{caption="Saving attachments to RavenDB as part of opening the support call" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var call = new SupportCall
    {
        Started = DateTime.UtcNow,
        Issue = customerIssue,
        CustomerId = customerId
    };
    session.Store(call);

    foreach (var file in attachedFiles)
    {
        session.Advanced.StoreAttachment(call, file.Name, 
            file.OpenStream());
    }

    session.SaveChanges();
}
```

Note that we're using the session to store both the support call document and any attachments the user might have sent. An attachment is basically
a file name and a stream that will be sent to the server (with an optional content type). When the call to `SaveChanges` is made, the RavenDB client API
will send both the new document and all of its attachments to the server in a single call, which will be treated as a transaction. Both the document and
the attachments will be saved, or both will fail.

That was easy enough, but now how do we retrieve the attachments? The list of attachments for a particular document is accessible via the session, as shown
in Listing 4.4. 

```{caption="Getting the list of attachments for a support call" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var call = session.Load<SupportCall>("SupportCalls/238-B");
    var attachments = session.Advanced.GetAttachmentNames(call);

    // render the call and the attachment names
}
```

Calling `GetAttachmentNames` is cheap; the attachments on a document are already present in the document metadata, which we loaded as part of
getting the document. There is no server-side call involved. Note that the result of `GetAttachmentNames` doesn't include the _content_ of the 
attachments. To get the attachment itself and not just its name, you need to make an additional call, as shown in Listing 4.5.

```{caption="Getting an attachment content" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var call = session.Load<SupportCall>("SupportCalls/238-B");
    var attachments = session.Advanced.GetAttachmentNames(call);

    using (var stream = session.Advanced.GetAttachment(call, 
        attachments[0].Name))
    {
        // process the content of the attachment 
    }
}
```

Each call to `GetAttachment` will make a separate call to the server to fetch the attachment. If you have a lot of attachments, be aware that 
fetching all their information can be expensive due to the number of remote calls that are involved. 

#### Working with the document metadata

In the attachments section, we noted that attachment information is stored in the document metadata. RavenDB uses the metadata for a lot of things.
Most of them you don't generally care about (etag, change vector, etc.). But the document metadata is also available to you for your own needs and 
use. 

An actual use case for direct use of the document metadata is pretty rare. If you want to store information, you'll typically want to 
store it in the document itself, not throw it to the metadata sidelines. Typical use cases for storing data in the metadata are cross-cutting
concerns. The preeminent one is auditing. You may want to see who edited a document, for example. 

In order to demonstrate working with the metadata, we'll consider creating a support call. Handling a support call can be a complex process that has to go through several steps. In this case, 
we will save the new support call document to RavenDB with a draft status in the metadata.
 Typical modeling advice would be to model this 
explicitly in the domain (so you'll have an `IsDraft` or `Status` property on your model), but for this example, we'll use the metadata. You can see
the code for setting a draft status in the metadata in Listing 4.6.

```{caption="Setting a metadata flag as part of creating a new support call" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var call = new SupportCall
    {
        Started = DateTime.UtcNow,
        Issue = customerIssue,
        CustomerId = customerId
    };
    session.Store(call);

    var metadata = session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(call);
    metadata["Status"] = "Draft";

    session.SaveChanges();
}
```

We can call `GetMetadataFor` on any document that has been associated with the session. A document is associated with the session either by loading
it from the server or by calling `Store`. After the document has been associated with the session, we can get its metadata and manipulate it.

Changes to the metadata count as changes to the document and will cause the document to be saved to the server when `SaveChanges` is called. 

#### Change tracking and `SaveChanges`

The document session implements change tracking on your documents, as you can see in Listing 4.7.

```{caption="Saving the changes to a document without manually tracking what changed" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var call = session.Load<SupportCall>("SupportCalls/238-B");
  
    call.Ended = DateTime.UtcNow;

    session.SaveChanges();
}
```

The session's change tracking (and identity map) means that you don't have to keep track of what changed and manually call `Store`. Instead, when
you call `SaveChanges`, all your changes will be sent to the server in a single request. 

You have a few knobs available to tweak the process. `session.Advanced.HasChanges` will let you know if calling `SaveChanges` will result in a call to the 
server. And `session.Advanced.HasChanged(entity)` will tell you when a particular `entity` has changed. You can also take it up a notch and ask RavenDB
to tell you _what_ changed, using `session.Advanced.WhatChanged()`. This will give you all the changes that happened in the session. The `WhatChanged` 
feature can be nice if you want to highlight changes for user approval, for example, or if you just want to see what modifications were made to your model
after a certain operation.

You can also tell RavenDB not to update a particular instance by calling `session.Advanced.IgnoreChangesFor(entity)`. The document will remain attached to
the session and will be part of any identity map operations, but it won't be saved to the server when `SaveChanges` is called. Alternatively, you can call
`session.Advanced.Evict(entity)` to make the session completely forget about a document. 

These operations tend to be useful only in specific cases, but they are very powerful when utilized properly. 

#### Optimistic concurrency

We covered optimistic concurrency in Chapter 3, but only in the most general terms. Now, let's take a look and see how we can use optimistic
concurrency in practice. Listing 4.8 shows two simultaneous sessions modifying the same support call. 

```{caption="Concurrent modifications of a support call" .cs}
using (var sessionOne = store.OpenSession())
using (var sessionTwo = store.OpenSession())
{
    var callOne = sessionOne.Load<SupportCall>("SupportCalls/238-B");
    var callTwo = sessionTwo.Load<SupportCall>("SupportCalls/238-B");
  
    callOne.Ended = DateTime.Today;
    callTwo.Ended = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1);
  
    sessionOne.SaveChanges();
    sessionTwo.SaveChanges();
}
```

In the case of the code in Listing 4.8, we're always going to end up with the support call end date set to tomorrow. This is because, by default, RavenDB
uses the `Last Write Wins` model. You can change that by setting `store.Conventions.UseOptimisticConcurrency` to "true," which will affect all sessions, or you can change it 
on a case-by-case basis by setting `session.Advanced.UseOptimisticConcurrency` to "true" on the session directly.

In either case, when this flag is set and `SaveChanges` is called, we'll send the modified documents to the server alongside their change vectors that were received from the server when loading the documents. This allows the server to reject any stale writes. If the flag were set to true, the code in Listing 4.8 would result in a 
`ConcurrencyException` on the `sessionTwo.SaveChanges()` call.

This ensures that you can't overwrite changes you didn't see, and if you set `UseOptimisticConcurrency`, you need to handle this error in some manner.

##### Pessimistic locking

When changes happen behind our backs to the document we modified, optimistic locking handles it. Pessimistic locking, on the other hand, prevents those changes entirely. 
RavenDB does _not_ support pessimistic locking. And while you really need support from the database engine to properly implement pessimistic locking, we fake it in an interesting way. The following is a recipe for using
approximating pessimistic locking in RavenDB.  We mention it not so much because it's a good idea, but because it allows us to explore several different features and see how they
work together.

Using pessimistic locking, we can lock a document for modification until we release the lock or until a certain amount of time has gone by. We can build a pessimistic 
lock in RavenDB by utilizing the document metadata and optimistic concurrency. It's easier to explain with code, and you can find the `Lock` and `Unlock`
implementations in Listing 4.9.

> **The locks are opt-in**
>
> In RavenDB, both the pessimistic lock explored in this section and the optimistic lock in the previous section are opt-in. That means that you have to
> explicitly participate in the lock. If you're using `UseOptimisticConcurrency` and another thread isn't, that thread will get the `Last Write Wins`

> not be respected.
>
> In short, when using concurrency control, make sure that you're using it across the board, or it may not hold.

```{caption="Extension method to add pessimistic locking to the session" .cs}
public static IDisposable Lock(
    this IDocumentSession session, 
    string docToLock)
{
  var doc = session.Load<object>(docToLock);
  if (doc == null)
      throw new DocumentDoesNotExistException("The document " + 
          docToLock + " does not exists and cannot be locked");

  var metadata = session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(doc);
  if (metadata.GetBoolean("Pessimistic-Locked"))
  {
      // the document is locked and the lock is still value
      var ticks = metadata.GetNumber("Pessimistic-Lock-Timeout");
      var lockedUntil = new DateTime(ticks);
      if (DateTime.UtcNow <= lockedUntil)
          throw new ConcurrencyException("Document " + 
              docToLock + " is locked using pessimistic");
  }
  
  metadata["Pessimistic-Locked"] = true;
  metadata["Pessimistic-Lock-Timeout"] = 
      DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(15).Ticks;
  
  // will throw if someone else took the look in the meantime
  session.Advanced.UseOptimisticConcurrency = true;
  session.SaveChanges();

  return new DisposableAction(() =>
  {
      metadata.Remove("Pessimistic-Locked");
      metadata.Remove("Pessimistic-Lock-Timeout");
      Debug.Assert(session.Advanced.UseOptimisticConcurrency);
      session.SaveChanges();
  });
}
```

There's quite a bit of code in Listing 4.9, but there isn't actually a lot that gets done. We load a document and check if its metadata contains the
`Pessimistic-Locked` value. If it does, we check if the lock time  expired. If it isn't locked, we first update the document metadata,
then enable _optimistic_ concurrency and finally call `SaveChanges`. If no one else modified the document in the meantime, we'll successfully mark the 
document as ours, and any other call to `Lock` will fail.

The `Lock` method returns an `IDisposable` instance that handles releasing the lock. This is done by removing the metadata values and then calling 
`SaveChanges` again. If the lock has timed out and someone took the lock, we'll fail here with a concurrency exception as well.

A typical use for pessimistic locks is to lock a document while a user is editing it. That might sound like a good idea, but experience has shown that, 
in most cases, it leads to trouble. Consider, for example, version control systems. If you're reading this book, you've likely used a SCM of
some kind. If you haven't, I suggest you pick up a book about source control and prioritize it over this one: learning about that is far more foundational.

Early source control systems (SourceSafe is a good example) used locks as their concurrency model, and that led to a lot of problems. Say Joe locks
a file and then leaves on vacation. All of his coworkers then have to wait until he gets back before committing code to that  file. This is a typical problem that arises in such cases. The same happens when you have pessimistic locks.
Implementing pessimistic locks requires you to also implement forced lock release, a feature that tells you who locked the document and a whole slew of management
functions around it. Typically, implementing optimistic concurrency or merging is easier and matches most users' expectations.

##### Offline optimistic concurrency

We looked at online optimistic concurrency in Listing 4.8, where we loaded a document into the session, modified it and then saved. In that time frame, if 
there was a change, we'd get a concurrency exception. But most software doesn't work like that. In a web application, you aren't going to keep the 
document session open for as long as the user is on the site. Instead, most likely you'll use a session-per-request model. The user will load a page with the document's content in one request and modify it in another request. There isn't a shared session in sight, so how can we implement optimistic
concurrency?

All you need to do is send the change vector of the document to the user and accept it back when the user wants to save the document. Listing 4.10 shows an
example using two separate sessions with concurrency handling between them.

```{caption="Concurrent modifications of a support call" .cs}
string changeVector;
Supportcall callOne;

using (var sessionOne = store.OpenSession())
using (var sessionTwo = store.OpenSession())
{
    callOne = sessionOne.Load<SupportCall>("SupportCalls/238-B");
    changeVector = sessionOne.Advanced.GetChangeVectorFor(callOne);
    
    var callTwo = sessionTwo.Load<SupportCall>("SupportCalls/238-B");
    
    callTwo.Ended = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1);
    
    sessionTwo.SaveChanges();
}

using (var sessionThree = store.OpenSession())
{
    sessionThree.Advanced.UseOptimisticConcurrency = true;

    callOne.Ended = DateTime.Today;

    sessionThree.Store(callOne, changeVector, callOne.Id);

    sessionThree.SaveChanges(); // will raise ConcurrencyException
}
```

The code in Listing 4.10 first loads the support call in `sessionOne`. Then the code loads it again in `sessionTwo`, modifies the support call and saves it to the server. 
Both sessions are then closed, and we open a _new_ session, `sessionThree`. We call `Store`, passing the entity instance and the change vector that we got from the first session, as 
well as the document ID. 

This gives the RavenDB client API enough information for us to do an optimistic concurrency check from the time we loaded `callOne` in the first session. In
a web scenario, you'll typically send the change vector alongside the actual data and get it back from the client to do the check. You might also want to check out the 
`Changes API`, which is covered a little later in this chapter. This might help you get early change notifications when you need to implement offline
optimistic concurrency.

#### Patching documents and concurrent modifications

The typical workflow with RavenDB is to open a session, load a document, run some business logic and call `SaveChanges`. When you follow those steps, the
session will figure out what documents have changed and send them to the server. This model is simple and easy to follow, and it's the recommended way to work.

However, there are a few scenarios in which we don't want to send the entire document back to the server. For example, if our document is very large and we want to make a 
small change, we can avoid that cost. Another reason to avoid the full document save is a scenario that calls for concurrent work
on a document.

Let's consider the `SupportCall.Votes` property. Two users may very well want to vote on the same support call at the same time. One way to handle that is to
load the support call, increment the `Votes` property and call `SaveChanges`. In order to handle concurrent modifications, we can utilize optimistic 
concurrency and retries. But that's quite a lot of work to write, and if the document is large, there's also a lot of data going back and forth over the 
network for little reason. Listing 4.11 shows how we can do much better.

```{caption="Incrementing a property using the Patch API" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    session.Advanced.Increment<SupportCall, int>("SupportCalls/238-B", c => c.Votes, 1);

    session.SaveChanges();
}
```

What the code in Listing 4.11 does is generate a patch request, rather than load and save the full document. That request is stored in the session, and when
`SaveChanges` is called, it will be sent to the server (alongside any other changes/operations made on the session, as usual). On the server side, we'll apply
this operation to the document. This patch request is safe to call concurrently, since there's no loss of data when executing patches.

A slightly more complex example of the use of patching is adding a comment to a `SupportCall`. Just like before, we want to support adding a comment 
concurrently. But to make things a bit more interesting, we'll add a business rule: a call that has been ended cannot have additional comments added to
it. Listing 4.12 shows the obvious way to accomplish this.

```{caption="Adding a comment to a support call using patch" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var call = session.Load<SupportCall>("SupportCalls/238-B");
    if (call.Ended != null)
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot comment on closed call");

    session.Advanced.Patch(call, c => c.Comments, 
        comments => comments.Add("This is important stuff!"));

    session.SaveChanges();
}
```

In Listing 4.12, you can see how we moved from using the simple `Increment` call to the `Patch`, which allows us to either replace a property value completely or add an item to a collection. If you look closely at the code in Listing 4.12, you'll find that there's a hidden race condition there. The business rule
is that we can't add comments to a closed call; we're able to load the call, check that its `Ended` property is null and then 
send the patch request to the server. However, in the meantime, another client could have closed the call, and yet we'd still add the comment.

The seriousness of this issue depends entirely on the domain and the model. It's possible that you _do_ want to add comments during that period, 
or it's possible that allowing it could break important business invariants. 

> **Patch requests are sent as part of `SaveChanges`**
>
> It's probably obvious, but I wanted to spell this out explicitly. Calls to `Patch`, `Increment` or `Defer` don't go to the server immediately. Instead, they're

There are two ways to avoid the race condition. We can send a change vector to the server asking it to fail with a concurrency exception if the document has been 
modified since we last saw it. That _works_, but it defeats the whole point of using patches for concurrent modification of the document. The second alternative
is to move the invariant check into the script itself. Calls to `Increment` and `Patch` are actually just wrappers around the `Defer` call, which allows you to
add work to the session that's to be sent to the server when `SaveChanges` is called.

In Listing 4.13, we're dropping down to using `Defer` directly to manipulate the patch request ourselves, with no wrappers. As you can see, this is a bit involved,
but overall it's pretty straightforward.

```{caption="Using a patch script to maintain call invariants" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    session.Advanced.Defer(new PatchCommandData(
        id: "SupportCalls/238-B",
        changeVector: null, 
        patch: new PatchRequest
        {
            Script = @"
                if (this.Ended == null)
                    throw 'Cannot add a comment to a closed call';
                this.Comments.push($comment);
                ",
            Values =
            {
                ["comment"] = "This is important stuff!!"
            } 
        },
    patchIfMissing: null));
  
    session.SaveChanges();
}
```

The code in Listing 4.13 passes a `PatchCommandData`, containing the relevant document ID, to `Defer`. The key part is in the `PatchRequest` itself. We do the check on
the document and fail if the call has already been closed. If it hasn't, we add the comment to the call. You can also see that we don't have to deal with string
concatenation here since we can pass arguments to the scripts directly. There's also the option to run a script if the document does not exist. This gives you 
the option to do a "modify or create" style of operation.

Using this method, we can be sure that we'll never violate the rule about adding comments to a closed call. A cautionary word, though: this is more complex than anything we've dealt with
before, and I would only recommend doing it if you really must. 
Running logic in this manner inside the database is a powerful technique, but it's also usually a bad idea because of its potential for abuse. Problems that come with abusing this feature include the scripts being run under a lock, which prevents the database from completing transactions quickly. If you find yourself doing something like this frequently, stop and reconsider.  

#### Deferring commands

In the previous section, we used the `Defer` method to register a `PatchCommandData` on the session, to be executed when `SaveChanges` is called. But `Defer` is
more generic then this. It's a general mechanism for the user to register arbitrary commands that will be part of the same transaction as the `SaveChanges`. 

> **The RavenDB API is like an ogre. It has layers**
>
> Like the popular character Shrek, RavenDB API is composed of layers. At the top, you have the document store and the document session. Those are built using the operations concept, which you

The available commands range from putting and deleting documents and attachments to applying patches that delete documents having some prefix. Aside from the patch
operation, the rest are only useful in rare cases. The most common use of `Defer` beyond patch is when you need fine-grained control over the operations
that will be executed in a single transaction, to the point where you want to control the ordering of the operations.

RavenDB doesn't allow changing the document's collection, you can't just update the `@collection` metadata. So, if you need to do this,[^2] you must first delete the old document and then create a new one with the appropriate collection. The session doesn't allow you to both
delete and modify a document. And for the purpose of discussion, let's say that we _have_ to make this in a single transaction, so no other client sees a 
point in time where the document was deleted.

To be clear, this is a strange situation, dreamt up specifically to showcase a feature that should be only used in special circumstances.
This escape hatch in the API is specifically intended to prevent you from being blocked if you need something we didn't foresee, but I can't emphasize enough that 
this is probably a bad idea. The emergency exit is important, but you don't want to make it the front door.

Another reason to avoid using `Defer` is that it's lower in the RavenDB client API layers. Instead of dealing with high level concepts 
like entity, you'll be dealing with the direct manner in which RavenDB is representing JSON, the blittable format (which we'll discuss later in this chapter). That format is meant to be high performance,
and things like developer convenience were secondary in its design. 

#### Bulk inserting documents to RavenDB

RavenDB is fast, _really_ fast, but it still needs to face operational realities. The 
[fallacies of distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing) still apply, and I/O takes a non-trivial amount of time.
This means that when you want to get the best speed out of RavenDB, you need to help it achieve that.

Listing 4.14 shows the absolute slowest way to write 10,000 documents into RavenDB.

```{caption="Writing 10,000 documents, one at a time" .cs}
var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();
for (int i = 0; i < 10_000; i++)
{
    using (var session = store.OpenSession())
    {
        session.Store(new Customer
        {
            Name = "Customer #" + i
        });
        session.SaveChanges();
    }
}
Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);
```

For fun, I decided to run the code in Listing 4.14 against the live test instance we have. That instance was in San Francisco, and I was testing this from
Israel. The test instance was also running as a container inside an AWS t2.medium machine (two cores and 4 GB of memory, with burst-only mode). In other words, this
performance test was heavily biased against RavenDB, and the results were not great. In fact, they were _bad_.

This is because we're running each write as an independent operation, and we have to wait for the previous operation to complete before we can start the new one.
What's more, the database server handles just a single request concurrently, which means we have no way to amortize I/O costs across multiple requests. This
is the absolute worst way you can write a large amount of documents into RavenDB because most of the time is spent just going back and forth
between the client and the application. For each request, we have to make another REST call, send a packet to the server, etc. On the other side, the server accepts
a new request, processes it and commits it to disk. During the entire process, it's effectively idle, since most of the time is spent waiting for I/O. That's a big waste all around.

You can see the various times nicely when looking at the Fiddler[^3] statistics. Each request takes about 220&ndash;260 milliseconds to run. Writing the first
1,000 documents took four minutes and six seconds, and 2,000 requests took eight minutes on the dot. The full 10,000 documents would take 40 minutes or so. 
Granted, we're intentionally going to a remote server, but still... 

What happens when we're running the writes in parallel? The code in Listing 4.15 shows how to do this.

```{caption="Writing 10,000 documents, with a bit of parallelism thrown in" .cs}
var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();
Parallel.For(0, 10_000, i =>
{
    using (var session = store.OpenSession())
    {
        session.Store(new Customer
        {
            Name = "Customer #" + i
        });
        session.SaveChanges();
    }
});
Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);
```

Using the method in Listing 4.15, I was able to write 1,000 documents in 56 seconds. We got to 2,000 in a minute and a half, 3,000 in a minute and 50 seconds, 
etc. The reason for the speed up is actually related to how thread pooling is handled on the client side. Since we make a lot of blocking requests, the thread pool figures out that
we have plenty of blocking work and creates more threads. That means we have the chance to do more concurrent work. So as time goes by, more threads are
created and we make additional concurrent requests to RavenDB. 

The total time of writing 10,000 documents in this setup was two minutes and 52 seconds. So we've gotten done 20 times faster than we did using sequential writes. The code in Listing 4.15 is still using synchronous calls, which means the client side is spinning threads to handle the load and we're
limited by the rate of new thread creation on the client. 

RavenDB also supports an async API, which is much more suitable for scale-out scenarios because we aren't holding a thread for the duration of the connection. Listing 
4.16 shows how we can write all those documents in parallel,  using the async API. The code is a tad complex because we want to control the number of concurrent
requests we make. Spinning 10,000 concurrent requests will likely load the network and require careful attention to how they are managed, which is out of scope
for this book. Instead, I limited the number of concurrent connections to 128.

```{caption="Writing 10,000 documents, using async API" .cs}
var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();
var semaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(128);

async Task WriteDocument(int i)
{
    using (var session = store.OpenAsyncSession())
    {
        await session.StoreAsync(new Customer
        {
            Name = "Customer #" + i
        });
        await session.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
    semaphore.Release();
}

var tasks = new List<Task>();
for (int i = 0; i < 10_000; i++)
{
    semaphore.Wait();
    tasks.Add(WriteDocument(i));
}

Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());

Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);
```

The code in Listing 4.16 is also using a local method, which is a new C# 7.0 feature. It allows you to package a bit of behavior quite nicely, and it's very useful for
small demos and internal async code. This code writes 1,000 documents in just under 10 seconds, and it completes the full 10,000 writes in under 30 seconds (29.6, on
my machine). The speed difference is, again, related to the client learning our pattern of behavior and adjusting itself accordingly (creating enough buffers, threads
and other resources needed; warming up the TCP connections.[^4])

However, we really had to make an effort. We wrote explicit async code and managed it, rate-limited our behavior and jumped through several hoops to get a more reasonable level of 
performance. Note that we went from over 40 minutes to less than 30 seconds in the span of a few pages. Also note that we haven't actually modified _what_ we're doing &mdash; we only changed how we're talking to the server &mdash; but it had a huge impact on performance.

You can take it as a given that RavenDB is able to process as much data as you can feed it. The typical concern in handling writes is how fast we can get the 
data to the server, not how fast the server can handle it. 

RavenDB contains a dedicated API and behavior that makes it easier to deal with bulk loading scenarios. The bulk insert API uses a single connection to talk to the
server and is able to make much better use of the network. The entire process is carefully orchestrated by both the client and the server to optimize performance. 
Let's look at the code in Listing 4.17 first and then discuss the details.

```{caption="using bulk insert to write 100,000 documents, quickly" .cs}
var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();

using (var bulkInsert = store.BulkInsert())
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++)
    {
        bulkInsert.Store(new Customer
        {
            Name = "Customer #" + i
        });
    }
}

Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);
```

The code in Listing 4.17 took two minutes and 10 seconds to run on my machine &mdash; which is interesting, because it seems slower than the async API usage sample, right?
Except there's one problem. I made a typo when writing the code and wrote a _hundred_ thousand documents instead of _ten_ thousand. If I was writing merely 10,000 documents, it
would complete in about 18 seconds. The code is fairly trivial to write, similar to our first sample in Listing 4.14, but the performance is many times faster.

To compare the costs, I ran the same code against a local machine, giving me a total time of 11 seconds to insert 100,000 documents (instead of two minutes 
remotely). If we wanted to compare apples with apples, then the cost for writing 10,000 documents is shown in Table. 4.1.


|                |   Remote    |    Local    |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Session        | 41 *minutes*| 20 seconds  |
| Bulk Insert    | 18 seconds  | 6.5 seconds |

Table:  Bulk insert costs locally and remotely

You can see that while bulk insert is significantly faster in all cases, being over three times faster than the session option (Listing 4.14) locally seems insignificant considering it's over 130 times faster in the remote case. The major difference, as you can imagine, is the cost of going over the network, 
but even on the local machine (and we're not even talking about  the local network), there's a significant performance benefit for bulk insert.

Amusingly enough, using bulk insert still doesn't saturate the server. For large datasets, it's advisable to have parallel bulk insert operations going at
the same time. This gives the server more work to do, and it allows us to do optimizations that increase the ingest rate of the server.

The way bulk insert works is by opening a single long running request to the server and writing the raw data directly into the database. That means we don't need to go 
back and forth between the client and the server and can rely on a single network roundtrip to do all the work. The server, for its part, will read the data from the network
and write it to disk when it's best to do so. In other words, bulk inserts are _not_ transactional. A bulk insert is actually composed of many smaller transactions,
whose size and scope are determined by the server based on its own calculations, in order to maximize performance.

When the bulk insert is completed, you can rest assured that all the data has been safely committed to disk properly. But during the process, the data is committed incrementally instead of going with a single big-bang approach.

For the most part, RavenDB performance is ruled by how many requests you can send it. The more requests, the higher the degree of parallelism and the more efficiently 
RavenDB can work. In our internal tests, we routinely bumped into hardware limits (the network card cannot process packets any faster, the disk I/O is saturated, 
etc.), not software ones. 

### Reading documents

We just spent a lot of time learning how we can write documents to RavenDB in all sorts of interesting ways. But for reading, how much is there really to know? We already learned how to load and query a document; we covered that in ["Zero to RavenDB."](#zero-to-ravendb) We also covered `Include` and how
to use it to effortlessly get referenced documents from the server. What else is there to talk about? As it turns out, quite a bit. 

In most applications, reads are far more numerous than writes &mdash; often by an order of magnitude. That means RavenDB needs to be prepared to handle a
_lot_ of reads, and those applications typically have a number of ways in which they access, shape and consume the data. RavenDB needs to be able to provide an
answer to all those needs.

The first feature I want to present allows you to dramatically increase your overall performance by being a little lazy.

#### Lazy requests

In Section 4.1.7, which dealt with bulk insert, we saw how important the role of the network is. Running the same code on the local network vs. the public internet 
results in speed differences of 20 seconds to 41 _minutes_, just because of network latencies. On the other hand, moving from many requests to a single 
bulk insert request is the primary reason we cut our costs by two-thirds on the local machine and over two orders of magnitude in the remote case.

I talked about this a few times already, but it's important. The latency of going to the server and making a remote call is often much higher than the
cost of actually processing the request on the server. On the local machine, you'll probably not notice it much. That's normal for running in a
development environment. When you go to production, your database is typically going to run on a dedicated machine,[^5] so you'll have to go over the network to get it. And that dramatically increases the cost of going to the database.

This problem is well known: it's the [fallacies of distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing). RavenDB handles the issue in several ways. A session has a budget on the number of remote calls it can make. (This is controlled by
`session.Advanced.MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession`.) If it goes over that limit, an exception is thrown. We had this feature from the get-go, and that
led to a lot of thinking about how we can reduce the number of remote calls.

`Include` is obviously one such case. Instead of going to the server multiple times, we let the server know we'll need additional information after this request and tell it to send that immediately. But we can't always do that. Let's take a look at Listing 4.18, showing two queries that we
can't optimize using `Include`.

```{caption="Loading a customer and the count of support calls for that customer" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var customer = session.Load<Customer>("customers/8243-C");
    var countOfCalls = session.Query<SupportCall>()
        .Where(c => c.CustomerId == "customers/8243-C"))
        .Count();

    // show the customer and the number of calls to the user
}
```

A scenario like the one outlined in Listing 4.18 is incredibly common. We have many cases where we need to show the user information from multiple sources,
and that's a concern. Each of those calls turns out to be a _remote_ call, requiring us to go over the network. There are ways to optimize this specific
scenario. We can define a MapReduce index and run a query and `Include` on it. We haven't yet gone over exactly what this means,[^6] but this is a pretty complex solution, and it isn't relevant when you have different 
types of queries. If we wanted to also load the logged-in user, for example, that wouldn't work.

RavenDB's solution for this issue is the notion of lazy requests. A lazy request isn't actually being executed when you make it. Instead, it's 
stored in the session, and you get a `Lazy<T>` instance back. You can make multiple lazy requests, one after another, and no network activity will occur. However,
as soon as you access the _value_ of one of those lazy instances, all the lazy requests held up by the session will be sent to the server as a single
unit.

All those requests will be processed by the server, and all the replies will be sent as a single unit. So no matter how many lazy requests you have, there will
only ever be a single network round trip to the server. You can see the code sample in Listing 4.19.

```{caption="Lazily loading a customer and their count of support calls" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    Lazy<Customer> lazyCustomer = session.Advanced.Lazily
        .Load<Customer>("customers/8243-C");

    Lazy<int> lazyCountOfCalls = session.Query<SupportCall>()
        .Where(c => c.CustomerId == "customers/8243-C"))
        .CountLazily();

    // no network calls have been made so far

    // force execution of pending lazy operations explicitly
    session.Advanced.Eagerly.ExecuteAllPendingLazyOperations(); 

    // if ExecuteAllPendingLazyOperations wasn't called, it 
    // will be implicitly called here.
    int countOfCalls = lazyCountOfCalls.Value;
    Customer customer = lazyCustomer.Value;

    // show the customer and the number of calls to the user
}
```

As the code in Listing 4.19 shows, we can define multiple lazy operations. At that stage, they're pending. They're stored in the session but haven't been
sent to the server yet. We can either call `ExecuteAllPendingLazyOperations` to force all pending operations to execute, or we can have that happen implicitly
by accessing the `Value` property on any of the lazy instances we received.

>
> The existence of ExecuteAllPendingLazyOperations is strange. It's explicitly doing something that will happen implicitly anyway. So why is it needed?

The performance gain from `Lazy` is directly correlated to the number of lazy requests it's able to batch and how far away the actual server is. The more
requests that can be batched and the further away the database server, the faster this method becomes. On the local machine, it's rarely worth going to the trouble,
but once we go to production, this can get you some real benefits.

Note that, as useful as `Lazy` is, it's limited to requests that you can make with the information you have on hand. If you need to make queries based on the
results of another query, you won't be able to use `Lazy` for that. For most of those scenarios, you can use `Include`. And of course, `Lazy` and `Include`
can work together, so that will usually suffice.

#### Streaming data

When dealing with large amounts of data, the typical API we use to talk to RavenDB is not really suitable for the task. Let's consider the case of the code in
Listing 4.20.

```{caption="Query all support calls for a customer" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    List<SupportCall> calls = session.Query<SupportCall>()
        .Where(c => c.CustomerId == "customers/8243-C"))
        .ToList();
}
```

What will happen if this is a particularly troublesome customer that opened a _lot_ of calls? If this customer had just 30 calls, it's easy to see
that we'll get them all in the list. But what happens if this customer has 30,000 calls? Figure 4.1 shows how a query is processed on the server in this 
case. 

![A query using request buffering](./Ch04/img01.png)

The server will accept the query, find all matches, prepare the results to send and then send them all over the network. On the client side, we'll 
read the results from the network and batch them all into the list that we'll return to the application.

If there are 30 results in all, that's great, but if we have 30,000, we'll likely suffer from issues. Sending 30,000 results over the network, reading 30,000
results _from_ the network and then populating a list of 30,000 (potentially complex) objects is going to take some time. In terms of memory usage, we'll need
to hold all those results in memory, possibly for an extended period of time.

Due to the way memory management works in .NET,[^7] allocating a list with
a lot of objects over a period of time (because we are reading them from the network) will likely push the list instance, and all of its contents, into a higher
generation. This means that, when you're done using it, the memory will not be collected without a more expensive `Gen1` or even `Gen2` round. 

In short, for a large number of results, the code in Listing 4.20 will take more time, consume more memory and force more expensive GC in the future. In previous
versions of RavenDB, we had guards in place to prevent this scenario entirely. It's easy to start writing code like that in Listing 4.20 and
over time have more and more results come in. Our logic was that, at some point, there needed to be a cutoff point where an exception is thrown before this kind of behavior poisoned your application.

As it turned out, our users _really_ didn't like this behavior. In many cases, they would rather the application do more work (typically unnecessarily) than to have it
throw an error. This allowed them to fix a performance problem rather than a "system is down" issue. As a result of this feedback, this limitation was removed, but 
we still recommend always using a `Take` clause in your queries to prevent just this kind of issue. 

> **All queries should have a `Take` clause**

> a limit to the number of results they get.

Very large queries are bad, it seems, but that isn't actually the topic of this section. Instead, it's just the preface explaining why _buffered_ large 
queries are a bad idea. RavenDB also supports the notion of _streaming_ queries. You can see what that would look like in Figure 4.2.

![A query using request streaming](./Ch04/img02.png)

Unlike the previous example, with streaming, neither client nor server need to hold the full response in memory. Instead, as soon as the server has a single
result, it sends that result to the client. The client will read the result from the network, materialize the instance and hand it off to the application immediately.
In this manner, the application can start processing the results of the query before the server is done sending it, and it doesn't have to wait. You can see the
code for that in Listing 4.21.

```{caption="Stream all support calls for a customer" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var callsQuery = session.Query<SupportCall>()
        .Where(c => c.CustomerId == "customers/8243-C"));

    using (var stream = session.Advanced.Stream(callsQuery))
    {
        while (stream.MoveNext())
        {
            SupportCall current = stream.Current;
            // do something with this instance
        }
    }
}
```

Instead of getting all the results in one go, the code in Listing 4.21 will pull them from the stream one at a time. This way, the server, the client API and 
the application can all work in parallel with one another to process the results of the query. This technique is suitable for processing a large number of 
results (in the millions).

The use of streaming queries requires you to keep a few things in mind: 

* The results of a streaming query are _not_ tracked by the session. Changes made to them will not be sent to the server when `SaveChanges` is called. This is
  because we expect streaming queries to have a high number of results, and we don't want to hold all the references for them in the session. If we did,
  we would prevent the GC from collecting them.

* Since streaming is happening as a single large request, there's a limit to how long you can delay before you call `MoveNext` again. If you wait too long, 
  it's possible for the server to give up sending the rest of the request to you (since you didn't respond in time) and abort the connection. Typically, you'll
  be writing the results of the stream somewhere (to a file, to the network, etc.). 

* If you want to modify all the results of the query, don't call `session.Store` on each as they're pulled from the stream. You'll just generate an excess of work 
  for the session and eventually end up with a truly humongous batch to send to the server. Typically, if you want to read a lot of results and modify them, you'll
  use a stream and a `Bulk Insert` at the same time. You'll read from the stream and call `Store` on the bulk insert for each. This way, you'll have both streaming
  for the query as you read and streaming via the bulk insert on the write. 

When you need to select whether to use a regular (batched) query or a streaming query, consider the number of items that you expect to get from the query and
what you intend to do with them. If the number is small, you'll likely want to use a query for its simple API. If you need to process many results, you 
should use the streaming API.

Note that the streaming API is _intentionally_ a bit harder to use. We made sure the API exposes the streaming nature of the operation. You should strive to 
avoid wrapping that. Streaming should be used on the edge of your system, where you're doing something with the results and passing them directly to the outside 
in some manner.

### Caching

An important consideration when speeding up an application is caching. In particular, we can avoid expensive operations if we cache the results from the last time
we accessed them. Unfortunately, caching is _hard_. Phil Karlton [said](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html):

	There are only two hard things in Computer Science: 
	 cache invalidation and naming things.

Caching itself is pretty trivial to get right. The hard part is how you're going to handle cache invalidation. If you're serving stale information 
from the cache, the results can range from nothing much to critical, depending on what exactly you're doing. 

With RavenDB, we decided early on that caching was a complex topic, so we'd better handle it properly. It's done in two parts. The server side generates
an etag for all read operations. This etag is computed by the server and can be used by the client later on. The client, on the other hand, is able to cache the 
request from the server internally. The next time a similar read request is made, the client will send the cached etag to the server alongside the request.

When the server gets such a request with an etag, it follows a dedicated code path, optimized specifically for that, to check whether the results of the operation have 
changed. If they didn't, the server can return to the client immediately, letting it know that it's safe to use the cached copy. In this manner, we save computation costs on the server and network transfer costs between the server and the client. 

Externally, from the API consumer point of view, there's no way to tell that caching happened. Consider the code in Listing 4.22.

```{caption="Query caching in action" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var calls = session.Query<SupportCall>()
        .Where(c => c.CustomerId == "customers/8243-C"))
        .ToList();
}

using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    // this query will result in the server
    // returning a "this is cached" notification
    var calls = session.Query<SupportCall>()
        .Where(c => c.CustomerId == "customers/8243-C"))
        .ToList();
}
```

The client code doesn't need to change in any way to take advantage of this feature. This is on by default and is always there to try to speed up your requests. 
Caching is prevalent in RavenDB, so although the example in Listing 4.22 uses queries, loading a document will also use the cache, as will most other read operations.

The cache that's kept on the client side is the already-parsed results, so we saved not only the network round-trip time but also the parsing costs. We keep the 
data in _unmanaged_ memory because it's easier to keep track of the size of the memory and avoid promoting objects into Gen2 just because they've been in the 
cache for a while. The cache is scoped to the document store, so all sessions from the same document store will share the cache and its benefits. 

> **Time to skip the cache**

> Caching by default can be a problem with a particular set of queries &mdash; those that use the notion of the current time. Consider the case of the following query:

The cache works by utilizing HTTP caching behavior. Whenever we make a `GET` request, we check the cache to see if we previously made a request with the same URL and query
string parameters. If we did, we fetch the cached etag for that request and send it to the server. The server will then use that etag to check if the results have
changed. If they didn't, the server returns a `304 Not Modified` response. The client will then just use the cached response that it already has.

While most read requests are cached, there are a few that aren't. Anything that will always be different, such as stats calls, will never be cached. This is because stats and
debug endpoints must return fresh information any time they're called. Attachments are also not cached because they can be very large and are typically handled differently by the application.

#### Aggressive caching

Caching is great, it would seem. But in order to utilize caching by RavenDB, we still need to go back to the server. That ensures we'll get a server confirmation 
that the data we're going to return for that request is indeed fresh and valid. However, there are many cases where we don't care much about the freshness
of the data.

On a heavily used page, showing data that might be stale for a few minutes is absolutely fine, and the performance benefits gained from not having to go to the server 
can be quite nice. In order to address this scenario, RavenDB supports the notion of aggressive caching. You can see an example of that in Listing 4.23.

```{caption="Aggressive caching in action" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
using (session.Advanced.DocumentStore.AggressivelyCache())
{
    var customer = session.Load<SupportCall>(
        "customers/8243-C");
}
```

The code in Listing 4.23 uses aggressive caching. In this mode, if the request is in the cache, the RavenDB client API will _never_ even ask the server if it's 
up to date. Instead, it will immediately serve the request from the cache, skipping all network traffic. This can significantly speed up operations for which you
can live with a stale view of the world for a certain period. 

However, operating in this mode indefinitely would be pretty bad since you'd never see new results. This leads us back to the problem of cache invalidation. Aggressive caching 
isn't just going to blindly cache all data at all times. Instead, the first time it encounters an instruction to aggressively cache, the client is going
to open a connection to the server and ask the server to let it know whenever something changes in the database. This is done using the `Changes API`, which 
is covered in the next section of this chapter.

Whenever the server lets the client know that something has changed, the client will ensure that the next cached request will actually hit the server for the 
possibly updated value. The client will not be asking specifically for changes it has in its cache. Instead, it will ask for all changes on the server. 
(Take note of that, as you might be caching a lot of different queries, documents, etc.) 
The client knows to check with the server for anything in the cache that is older than that notification. 
When this is done, the cached etag is still being sent, so if that particular response hasn't changed, the server will still respond with a `304 Not Modified` 
and we'll use the cached value (and update its timestamp).

The idea is that, with this behavior, you get the best of both worlds. If nothing has changed, immediate caching is available without having to go to the server. But
if something might have changed, we'll check the server for the most up-to-date response. Given typical behavioral patterns for the application, we'll often be able to use the aggressive cache for quite some time before a write will come in and make us check with the server.

### Changes API

We mentioned the `Changes API` in the previous section since the aggressive caching is using it. The `Changes API` is a way for us to connect to the server and
ask it to let us know when a particular event has happened. Listing 4.24 shows how we can ask the server to tell us when a particular document has changed.

```{caption="Getting notified when a document changes" .cs}
var subscription = store.Changes()
    .ForDocument("customers/8243-C")
    .Subscribe(change => {
        // let user know the document changed
        });

// dispose to stop getting future notifications
subscription.Dispose(); 
```

Typically, we use the code in Listing 4.24 when implementing an edit page for a document. When the user starts editing the document, we register for notifications
on changes to this document. If it does change, we let the user know immediately. That allows us to avoid having to wait for the save action to discover we need to redo all our work.

The `Changes API` works by opening a WebSocket to the server and letting the server know exactly what kind of changes it's interested in. We can register for
a particular document, a collection, documents that start with a particular key, or even global events, such as operations or indexes. 

> **Changes API in a cluster**
>
> In a cluster, the `Changes API` will always connect to one node, and changes must first flow to that node before the changes will be sent to the client. The
> failure of the node will cause us to reconnect (possibly to a different server) and resume waiting for the changes we're interested in.

The `Changes API` is meant to get non-critical notifications. It's cheap to run and is pretty simple, but it's possible that a failure scenario will cause you
to miss updates. If the connection has been reset, you might lose notifications that happened while you were reconnecting. It's recommended that you use 
the `Changes API` for enrichment purposes and not rely on it. For example, you might use it to tell if a document has changed so you can not only give early notification but also ensure
you have optimistic concurrency turned on so it will catch the change on save anyway. 

Another example of a way you might use the `Changes API` is with aggressive caching. If we missed a single notification, that isn't too bad. The next notification will put us in the same state. And we'll
be fine because the user explicitly chose performance over getting the latest version, in this case. Yet another example of `Changes API` use might be for monitoring. You want to know what's going on in the server, but it's fine to lose something if there's an error because you're interested in what's happening now, not the full
and complete history of actions on the server.

For critical operations &mdash; ones where you can't afford to miss even a single change &mdash; you can use `Subscriptions`, which are covered in the next chapter. They're 
suited for such a scenario, since they guarantee that all notifications will be properly sent and acknowledged. 

### Projecting data in queries

In the previous chapter, we talked a lot about modeling and how we should structure our documents to be independent, isolated and coherent. That makes for an excellent
system for transaction processing (OLTP) scenarios. But there are quite a few cases where, even in a business application, we have to look at the data differently.
Let's take a look at our support case example. If I'm a help desk engineer and I'm looking at the list of open support calls, I want to see all the recent support
calls and the customer that opened them. 

Based on what we know so far, it would be trivial to write the code in Listing 4.25.

```{caption="Recent orders and their customers" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    List<SupportCall> recentOrders = session.Query<SupportCall>()
        .Include(c => c.CustomerId) // include customers
        .Where(c => c.Ended == null) // open order
        .OrderByDescending(c => c.Started) // get recent
        .Take(25) // limit the results
        .ToList();
}
```

The code in Listing 4.25 is doing a _lot_. It gets us the 25 most recently opened support calls, and it also includes the corresponding customers. We can now show this to
the user quite easily, and we were able to do that in a single request to the server. Under most circumstances, this is exactly what you'll want to do. 

However, in order to pull the few fields we need to show to the user in the application, we had to pull the full support calls and customers documents. If those documents are large, that can be expensive. Another way to handle this is by letting the server know exactly what we need returned
and then letting it do the work on the server side. 

This can be done by specifying a projection during the query. Projections allow us to control exactly what is being returned from the query. On the most basic level it
allows us to decide what fields we want to get from the server, but we can actually do a lot more than that. 

Let's see how we can use a query to project just the data that we are interested in. You can see the details in Listing 4.26.

```{caption="Recent orders and their customers, using projection" .cs}
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var recentOrders = (
        from call in session.Query<SupportCall>()
        where call.Ended == null // open order
        orderby call.Started descending // get recent
        // fetch customer (happens on the server side)
        let customer = session.Load<Customer>(call.CustomerId)
        select new 
        {
          // project just the data that we care about
          // back to the client
          CustomerName = customer.Name,
          call.CustomerId,
          call.Started,
          call.Issue,
          call.Votes
        }
    )
    .Take(25) // limit the results
    .ToList();
}
```

There are a few things to note in Listing 4.26. First, we no longer include the `Customer` in the query. We don't need that because the result of this query isn't a list
of `SupportCall` documents but a list of projections that already include the `CustomerName` that we want. The key part, as far as we're concerned, is the call to the 
`session.Load<Customer>()` method. This is translated into a server side load operation that fetches the related `Customer` document and extracts just the `Name` field from
it.[^8]

The output of a query like the one in Listing 4.26 is not a document, it is a projection and as a result of that, it isn't tracked by the session. 
This means that changes to a projection won't be saved back to the server when `SaveChanges` is called. You _can_ call `Store` on the result of a projection, but be 
aware that this will create a new document, which is probably isn't what you intended to happen.

### Cross-cutting concerns on the client

The RavenDB client API is quite big. We already discussed the notion of layers in the design of the client API, allowing you to select at what level you want to
work at any given point in time. There is quite a lot that you can configure and customize in the client behavior. The most common customization is changing the conventions of the client by providing your own logic. 

Most of the decisions that the RavenDB client API makes are actually controlled by the `DocumentConventions` class. This class allows you to modify all sorts
of behaviors, from how RavenDB should treat complex values in queries to selecting what property to use as the document ID in entities. 

If you need fine-grained control over the serialization and deserialization of your documents, this is the place to look. The `DocumentConventions` class holds important configurations, 
such as the maximum number of requests to allow per server or whether we should allow queries without a `Take` clause. Listing 4.27 shows an example of controlling
what collection an object will find itself in. 

```{caption="Customize the collection to allow polymorphism" .cs}
store.Conventions.FindCollectionName = type =>
    typeof(Customer).IsAssignableFrom(type)
        ? "customers"
        : DocumentConventions.DefaultGetCollectionName(type);
```

In Listing 4.27, we're letting RavenDB know that `Customer` or any derived type should be in the "customers" collection. That means that we can create a class 
called `VIPCustomer` that will have additional properties, but it will still be treated as a `Customer` by anything else (indexing, queries, etc.). Such options allow
you to have absolute control over how RavenDB will work within your environment.

#### Event handlers

Alongside conventions, which are typically reactive, you can use event handlers to perform various operations during the execution of requests by RavenDB. The 
events are available as events that can be subscribed to at the document store level or at the individual session level. 

The following events are available:

* OnBeforeStore
* OnAfterSaveChanges
* OnBeforeDelete
* OnBeforeQueryExecuted

This allows us to register to be called whenever a particular event happens, and that in turn gives us a lot of power. Listing 4.28 shows how we can implement
auditing with the help of the `OnBeforeStore` event.

```{caption="Implementing auditing mechanism" .cs}
store.OnBeforeStore += (sender, args) =>
{
    args.DocumentMetadata["Modified-By"] = 
        RequestContext.Principal.Identity.GetUserId();
};
```

Listing 4.28 ensures that whenever the document is modified, we'll register which user has made the modification in the metadata. You can also use this event
to handle validation in a cross-cutting fashion. Throwing an error from the event will abort the `SaveChanges` operation and raise the error to the caller. 

Another example of using events is to ensure that we always include a particular clause in our queries, as you can see in Listing 4.29.

```{caption="Never read inactive customer" .cs}
store.OnBeforeQueryExecuted += (sender, args) =>
{
    if (args.QueryCustomization is IDocumentQuery<Customer> query)
    {
        query.WhereEquals("IsActive", true);
    }
}
```

The code in Listing 4.29 will apply to all queries operating on `Customer` and will ensure that all the results returned have the `IsActive` property set to true. 
This can also be used in multi-tenancy situations, where you want to add the current tenant ID to all queries. 

The full details of what you can do with conventions and listeners are in RavenDB's online documentation. I encourage you to browse the documentation and consider when it
might make sense to use listeners in your application. Using them can be quite a time saver because listeners can be applied globally with ease. 

### Document revisions

In the previous section, we briefly mentioned auditing. In this section, we're going to take the notion of auditing and dial it up a notch, just to see what will 
happen. Certain classes of applications have very strict change control requirements for their data. For example, most medical, banking, payroll and insurance 
applications have strict "never delete since we need to be able to see all changes on the system" rules. One particular
system I worked with had the requirement to keep all changes for a minimum of seven years, for example. 

With RavenDB, this kind of system is much easier. That's because RavenDB has built-in support for handling revisions. Allow me to walk you through setting up such a system.

Go into the RavenDB Studio in the browser and create a new database, as we have seen in ["Zero to RavenDB."](#zero-to-ravendb) Now, go into the database, and on the
left side menu, click `Settings` and then `Document Revisions`. 

You can configure revisions globally for all collections or a single particular collection. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll define revisions 
for all collections, as seen in Figure 4.3.  You can enable revisions by clicking on `Create default configuration`, accepting the defaults by clicking `OK`
and then `Save`. 

![Setting up revisions for all collections](./Ch04/img03.png)

Now that we've enabled revisions, let's see what this means. Go ahead and create a simple customer document, as seen in Figure 4.4.

![Customer document with revisions enabled](./Ch04/img04.png)

You can see that this document has a `@flags` metadata property that is set to `HasRevisions`. And if you look at the right-hand side, you'll see a revisions
tab that you can select to see previous revisions of this document. Play around with this document for a bit, modify it, save and see how
revisions are recorded on each change.

Documents' revisions in RavenDB are created whenever you have revisions enabled and a document is modified. As part of saving the new document, we create a snapshot 
of the document (and its metadata, attachments, etc.) and store it as a revision. This allows us to go back in time and look at a previous revision of a document. 
In a way, this is similar to how we work with code. Every change creates a new revision, and we can go back in time and compare the changes 
between revisions.

> **Revisions in a cluster**
>
> In a cluster, revisions are going to be replicated to all the nodes in the database. Conflicts cannot occur with revisions, since each revision has
> its own distinct signature. One of the most common usages of revisions is to store the entire document history when you have automatic conflict
> resolution. We'll cover this behavior in depth in Chapter 6.

As part of configuring revisions on the database, you can select how many revisions we'll retain and for what period of time. For example, you may choose to
keep around 15 revisions for seven days. Under those conditions, RavenDB will delete all revisions that are _both_ older than seven days and have more than 15 revisions 
after them. In other words, if you've made 50 changes to a document in the span of a week, we'll keep all of them and only delete the earliest of them 
when they're over seven days old.

From the client side, you don't really need to consider revisions at all. This behavior happens purely on the server side and requires no involvement from
the client. But you can access the revisions through the client API, as you can see in Listing 4.30.

```{caption="Getting revisions of a document" .cs}
List<SupportCall> revisions = session.Advanced
    .GetRevisionsFor<SupportCall>("SupportCalls/238-B");
```

The code in Listing 4.30 will fetch the most recent revisions and provide you with the revisions of the 
document as it was changed. You can also page through the revision history.

Once a revision has been created, it cannot be changed. This is done to ensure compliance with strict regulatory requirements, since it means you can
treat the data in the revision as safe. It cannot be manipulated by the client API or even by the admin. 

I've found that some applications, without the regulations requiring versioning, make use of revisions just because they give the users an easy way to look at
the changes on an entity over time. That was especially true in one example I can recall, where the user in question was the business expert in charge of the whole system. This 
feature was very valuable to her since it allowed her to see exactly what happened and who took the action. (The application utilized a listener to implement audits, as shown
in Listing 4.29). It was quite interesting to see how much value she got out of this feature.

In terms of cost, revisions obviously increase the amount of disk space required. But given today's disk sizes, that isn't usually a significant concern. Aside
from disk space utilization, revisions don't actually have any impact on the system. Revisions are also quite important for ensuring that transaction boundaries are respected
when replicating changes in the cluster[^9], handling historical subscriptions[^10] and ETL processes.

### How RavenDB uses JSON

The RavenDB server and the RavenDB C# client API use a dedicated binary format to represent JSON in memory. 
The details on this format are too low level for this book and generally shouldn't be of much interest to outside parties, 
but it's worth understanding a bit about how RavenDB handles JSON even at this stage. Typically, you'll work 
with JSON documents in their stringified form &mdash; a set of UTF8 characters with the JSON format. That is human-readable, cheap to parse and simple to work with.

But JSON parsing requires you to work in a streaming manner, which means that to pull up just a few values from a big document, you still need to
parse the full document. As it turns out, once a document is inside RavenDB, there are a _lot_ of cases where we want to just get a couple of values 
from it. Indexing a few fields is common, and parsing the JSON each and every time can be incredibly costly. Instead, RavenDB accepts the JSON
string on write and turns it into an internal format called blittable.[^11] 

A blittable JSON document is a format that allows RavenDB random access to any piece of information in the document without having to parse the 
document, with a traversal cost of (amortised) O(1). Over the wire, RavenDB is sending JSON strings, but internally, it's all blittable.
The C# client is also using the blittable format internally since that greatly helps with memory consumption and control. You generally won't see
that in the public API, but certain low-level operations may expose you to it.

Blittable documents are immutable once created and _must_ be disposed of once you're done with them. Since the document session will typically hold
such blittable objects, the session must also be disposed of to make sure all the memory it's holding is released. An important consideration
for the overall performance of RavenDB is that blittable documents always reside in native memory. This allows RavenDB fine-grained
control over where and how the memory is used and reused, as well as its life cycle. 

On the client side, using the blittable format means we have reduced memory consumption and reduced fragmentation. It also reduces
the cost of caching significantly.

### Summary

In this chapter, we've gone over a lot of the advanced features in the client API. We looked at working with attachments and understanding how we can use them to store
binary data. Then we moved on to working with the document metadata in general. The document metadata is a convenient place to stash information about our 
documents that doesn't actually belong to the document itself. Auditing is one such example, and we saw how we can use listeners on
the events that the client API exposes to us.

We looked at how change tracking is managed and how we can get detailed information from the session about what exactly changed in our documents. Then we
examined how we should handle concurrency in our application. We looked at optimistic concurrency in RavenDB and even implemented _pessimistic_ 
locking.[^12] Online optimistic concurrency can be handled for us automatically by the 
session, or we can send the change vector value to the client and get it back on the next request, thus implementing offline optimistic concurrency.

There's another way to handle concurrency &mdash; or just to save yourself the trouble of shuffling lots of data between client and server &mdash; and that way is to use patching. The client API offers patching 
at several levels. Setting a value or incrementing a number is supported by a strongly typed API, but more complex tasks can be handled using `Defer`,
which also offers you the ability to write JavaScript code that will be executed on the server to mutate your documents.

We also looked at various ways to get a lot of data into RavenDB, from a sequential `SaveChanges` per document, to running them in parallel, to using the
bulk insert API to efficiently push data into RavenDB. We saw that the major limiting factor was typically the cost of going to the 
database and that different approaches could produce significantly different performance profiles. 

After looking at the various ways we could write data to RavenDB, it was time to look at the other side: seeing how we can optimize reads
from the server. We had already gone over `Include` in ["Zero to RavenDB,"](#zero-to-ravendb) and in this chapter we looked at lazy requests, allowing us to combine 
several different requests to the server into a single round trip.

The mirror image to bulk insert is the streaming feature, suitable for handling an immense amount of data. Streaming allows us to start processing the request
from the server immediately, without having to wait for the complete results. This allows us to parallelize the work between client and server and gives
us the option to immediately start sending results to the user.

Following the reading and writing of documents, we looked into caching them. The client API has sophisticated caching behaviors, and we delved into exactly
how that works, as well as how it reduces the time we need to provide answers to the user. Caching allows us to tell the server we already have the 
result of a previous call to the same URL. And it allows the server to let us know if that hasn't been modified. If that's the case, the server doesn't need to send
any results on the wire, and the client can use the cached (parsed and processed) data immediately. RavenDB also supports the notion of aggressive 
caching, which allows us to skip going to the server entirely. This is done by asking the server to notify the client when things change, and only then go to the server to fetch those changes.

That option is also exposed in the client API, using the changes API. The changes API gives you the ability to ask the server to tell you when a particular 
document, collection or set of documents with a given prefix has changed. This lets users know that someone has changed
the document they're working on, and allows them to implement features such as "this data has changed," etc.

Next, we looked at how we can project the results of queries and document loads on the server side using projections. A projection allows you to modify
the shape of the data that RavenDB returns to the client. This can be done by simply returning a subset of the data from the documents &mdash; or even by
loading additional documents and merging the data from associated documents into a single result. 

We looked at cross-cutting concerns on the client and how we can apply behavior throughout the client once. We can modify the client behavior  
by controlling how RavenDB decides what class belongs in what collection, as well as serialization and deserialization. Listeners allow you to 
attach behavior to certain actions in 
the client API, giving you the option to customize certain behaviors. We looked at adding auditing to our application in about three lines of code and 
even saw how we can limit all the queries on the client to only include active users as a cross-cutting behavior.

Following cross-cutting behaviors, we moved to looking at the revisions feature in RavenDB and how to use it from the client side. The revisions feature
asks the server to create a new revision of a document upon each change. Those revisions are immutable and create an audit trail and a change log for the 
documents in question. While this is primarily a server-side feature, we looked at how we can expose the revisions to the user through the client
API and allow the users to view previous revisions of a document. 

Our final endeavor was to cover at a high level the native serialization format that RavenDB uses, the blittable format. This format is meant to be extremely
efficient in representing JSON. It's typically stored in native memory to reduce managed memory consumption and garbage collection costs down the road. You
don't typically need to concern yourself with this, except to remember that it's important to dispose of sessions when you're done with them.

This chapter is a long one, but it still doesn't cover the full functionality. There are plenty of useful features, but they tend to
be useful in specific, narrow circumstances or only make sense to talk about in a larger scope. We've barely discussed queries so far, but 
we'll do so extensively when we get to Chapter 11 and when we discuss indexing.

The next chapter is a good example of this. We'll dedicate that chapter to handling data subscriptions and all the myriad ways they make data processing tasks easier for you.
