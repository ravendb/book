## Deploying to production

### Ensuring high availability

### Cluster topologies and usages

### Dedicing where databases go

## Monitoring and troubelshooting

### Backups, restores and disaster recovery

### Admin JS console

### Performance tracking

## Closing thoughts

TODO:

```
openssl s_client and in general, pointing out that it can be used to debug SSL issues

Required permissions
	- Files
	- Note running as a service vs. running as admin
	- set cap option in order to get the low ports

How to disconnect from a data source
	- Remove the cert that it uses

Delayed external replication - how to switch over to the delay copy


Cluster topologies
	Members vs watchers

	Ready made recommendations for various scenarios

Database group topology
	Reorder database group nodes and what this means
	Expanding database group 
	Scaling db group higher
	- Delay external replication
	- Automatic failover


Recommended configuration for production
	hardware, mostly
	split I/O devices
	explain how to split a db across hard disks
	drive paths, relative paths, etc

Indexing options - lock mode, priorities

Firewall configuration, in particular, the TCP port which can be hidden
	- open api.ravendb.net

Operating System details & configuration that is important
	- Linux, max number of open file handles
	- Windows, max amount of lockable memory
	- Set_cap, etc.


Trouble shooting
	- I/O metrics
	- Debug package
	- Threads endpoint
	- Memory endpoint
	- Monitoring in the studio
	- Debug endpoints
	- Logs and how to read them

Monitoring tools
	- Admin logs
	- Admin JS console
	- Traffic Watch

Recipes
	- Add capacity
		- Node
		- DB instance to db group
	- Move a db between nodes
	- Migrate a server between machines
	- Move server between machines

Disaster recovery
	- Voron.DisasterRecovery
	- How to bring a cluster up from a single node
	- rvn and the ravendb cli
	- recovering the keys to a cluster

Capacity planning
	- SLA
	- Measurable metrics

Maintenance
	- Compact
	- Disk space usage
	- Preventive maintienance (don't keep logs on same disk)

I/O behavior of RavenDB
	- Voron
	- Writes
	- Reads
	- Expected metrics

Backup / restore

	- Various backup options
	- How to restore a db in a single node
	- How to restore a db in a cluster (import, offline restore and then attach, etc)

	TEST YOUR RESTORE process

	A restore process can take hours / days on large databases.

	Cost of moving 200GB hard backup, then restoring it.
