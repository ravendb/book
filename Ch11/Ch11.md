## MapReduce and Aggregations in RavenDB

[Map Reduce]:(#map-reduce)

MapReduce is an old term. It came from Lisp and was used as early as the 1960s. For a long time, it was primarily known only by
functional language aficionados, and it was rarely seen outside their circles. In 2004, the Google paper
["MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters"](https://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf) was released, 
and MapReduce was instantly a big hit in the distributed programming circles. Everyone had to have a distributed MapReduce­
implementation.

RavenDB is a distributed database, and it uses MapReduce. However, it doesn't do so in the context of distributed computing. 
Instead, RavenDB uses MapReduce for aggregation of data on each node independently. If you're used to MapReduce jobs that run on large clusters processing terrabytes of data, this might look very strange. 
But RavenDB isn't using MapReduce to break apart large computations across different machines. Instead, it uses MapReduce to 
break apart computations across _time_.

It's usually easier to explain with an example, so let's jump into that.

### Executing simple aggregations

Listing 11.1 shows a simple aggregation query, giving us the total number of orders and items purchased by a particular company.

```{caption="A simple aggregation query in RavenDB" .sql}
from Orders as o
group by o.company
where o.company  = 'companies/1-A'
select count() as NumberOfOrders, 
	   sum(o.Lines[].Quantity) as ItemsPurchased, 
	   o.company
```

The query in Listing 11.1 should be familiar to anyone who's used SQL before. Now, let's analyze what RavenDB must do in
order to answer this kind of query:

1. Find all the `Orders` documents where the `company` field is set to `'companies/1-A'`.
2. Iterate over all of those, count their number and sum the number of line items in each.
3. Return the results to the client.

This seems quite straightforward, but it has a couple of issues&mdash;in particular, the first two steps. The sample data we're using
has just over a thousand documents in the database. There isn't much we can do to make any query expensive over that dataset.
However, with real-world datasets, we'll typically deal with collections that contain hundreds of thousands to many millions 
of documents. 

Consider the first step, which is finding all the `Orders` documents with the `company` field set to a value. If I have a few million 
documents to scan, that alone can be quite expensive, both in I/O (to read the data from disk) and computation (to check equality
so often). This is obviously something that we can optimize with an index. It's the next step that's hard to work with.

If a company has a _lot_ of orders, then the process of iterating over each of these orders can be extraordinarily expensive. 
Consider the case where you want to show the number of orders and the number of items purchased on the company page. This is a 
small amount of information that can tell you how important this particular customer is. 

However, if we need to repeat the second step each time we run the query, that can get expensive very quickly. What's 
worse is that the more important the company, the more orders and items this particular customer purchased from us and the slower 
things will become. This method won't work. It's punishing success, and that isn't something we want.

Typically, you won't run such queries directly because of their cost and time to run.
Instead, you'll write a job that will run these queries at idle times and cache the results. Then you only have to deal with cache invalidation, making sure that this job is never run under load, explaining to users that the results are delayed and...

It's complex. All you wanted was to put a couple numbers on a page, and suddenly you need to deploy a background job, monitor
its cost and execution and wait until the daily or weekly run to get updated numbers. Such a high cost of aggregation will usually
cause such features to be dropped.

And even if you don't have enough data to require such measures, aggregation queries are still typically costly for the 
database&mdash;enough so that they're used sparingly in most systems.

RavenDB's aggregation doesn't work like this. 

#### The gory details of aggregation in RavenDB

Instead of gathering all the data and then aggregating it all in place, RavenDB uses MapReduce to break apart the aggregation 
computation into discrete steps: the "map" and the "reduce." 

Let's look at how RavenDB _actually_ processes the query in Listing 11.1. Run the query in the listing and then click on the index button in the results, as shown in Figure 11.1.

We're going to go deep into how RavenDB is handling aggregations. You'll not typically need to know this level of detail, 
and you can feel free to just skip this section if you don't think you don't need such knowledge. I'm including it here because it's important to understand the implications of
how things work and that aggregation queries in RavenDB are _very_ cheap.

![Getting to the index details on the query page](./Ch11/img01.png)

You can already see that an aggregation query in RavenDB is also using an index. In addition to the usual options, such as the 
index terms and performance statistics, there's also the MapReduce visualizer, which we'll look at in more detail later. For now,
click on the `View Index` option, which should open the index details page shown in Figure 11.2.

![A Map-Reduce index aggregation `Orders` by `company`](./Ch11/img02.png)

Figure 11.2 shows the structure of the index. Operating over `Orders`, it groups by the `company` and aggregates over them. One thing to note here is that there's no mention anywhere of `companies/1-A`. Even though the query in
Listing 11.1 mentioned it, the index isn't operating on that particular value but rather on the generic concept of aggregating by
the `company` field.

In other words, as usual, RavenDB looked at the query and generalized the operation to answer any question using `company`. But what about the aggregation?

Aggregation is actually handled via two separate actions, `map` and `reduce`. The first stage runs a `map` operation on
each of the documents, grabbing just `company`, `sum(Lines[].Quantity)` and `Count = 1` from each of the `Orders` documents. The 
second stage is to group them all by `company` and run the `reduce` operation to get the final result by each of the 
`company` field values.

If this doesn't make sense to you, don't worry. RavenDB contains a few tools specifically to help you understand how the 
`MapReduce` process works.  

In the `Indexes` tab, go to `Map-Reduce Visualizer` and then select the `Auto/Orders/ByCountAndLines[].QuantityReducedBycompany`
index from the dropdown. Then search for the following document IDs: `orders/396-A` and `orders/445-A`. The result should look
similar to Figure 11.3.

![The MapReduce visualizer allows us to inspect the internal structure of the index](./Ch11/img03.png)

Clicking on the `{"company":"companies/1-A"}` rectangle in Figure 11.3 will give us more details about that particular value, as
you can see in Figure 11.4.

![A single reduce result and the total reduced value for a MapReduce index](./Ch11/img04.png)

With the details in Figures 11.3 and 11.4, you can now see exactly what I mean when I talk about `map` output and the resulting
aggregation. The documents we selected (`orders/396-A` and `orders/445-A`) both belong to `companies/1-A`, and we can see that 
for `orders/396-A`, the `map` output was `{"company": "companies/1-A","Count": 1,"Lines[].Quantity": 38}`. Indeed, if we go 
and inspect the document, we'll see three line items, with quantities of 15, 21 and 2, totaling  38. For `orders/445-A`, we can
see that the total quantity is 20, with a single line item. 

This is interesting, but what's even _more_ interesting is the aggregated value. For `companies/1-A`, you can see the aggregated 
values of a total of six orders for this company, with a final quantity of 174 items ordered. Clicking on the aggregation summary
will take us even further down, into the individual page entries, as you can see in Figure 11.5.

![Individual mapped entries for `companies/1-A`](./Ch11/img05.png)

In Figure 11.5, you can see all the details for each of the entries for `companies/1-A`. This is the lowest level we need to 
inspect as well as the reason why RavenDB implements aggregation in such a manner. I've already spent several pages now just explaining
what's going on. Why is the aggregation implementation for RavenDB so _complex_?

The reason is quite simple, actually. We don't run aggregation queries once; instead, we
compute the aggregation result once, and then we store it. When we issued the query in Listing 11.1, we queried only for results
for `companies/1-A`, but the index that the query optimizer generated for us applies to all companies.

In fact, if we now run the same query but for `companies/2-A`, we'll be able to reuse the same index. And in fact, we'll 
have to do very little work. The query will use the index and fetch the already precomputed results for `companies/2-A`. It won't have to actually perform any aggregation whatsoever. All the work has already been done. 

As great as that is, you might be asking yourself why there's this level of complexity. After all, surely we could have done the same thing
without so many moving parts, right? That's correct, but there's one additional item that you need to consider. How are we 
going to handle updates?

The MapReduce indexes in RavenDB aren't simply a cache of the already computed results. Instead, we store the data in such a 
way that makes it cheap to also update the results. Consider what will happen inside RavenDB when a new order comes in. We'll run
the `map` portion of the index, getting the `company`, `sum(Lines[].Quantity)` and `Count = 1` from the newly created document.

The easiest way to visualize that is to add another row to Figure 11.5. At this point, RavenDB can then just aggregate the
new results alongside the already existing result and get to the final tally. In other words, the complexity here exists in order
to allow RavenDB to efficiently update MapReduce results when documents are created or updated.

This works great when we have a small number of items to aggregate. Such is the case with `companies/1-A`. But what happens when
the number of items grow? Let's increase the number of documents we're aggregating by a hundred fold and see where that 
takes us. Go to `Documents` and then `Patch` and run the update script in Listing 11.2.

```{caption="Increase the number of Orders documents by a hundred" .sql}
from Orders 
update {
    for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++ ){
        put("orders/", this);
    }
}
```

After running this script, we should have about 83,000 Orders documents in the database. Where we previously had six entries for
`companies/1-A`, we now have 600. Let's look at how that works. 

Go back to the MapReduce visualizer and select the
`Auto/Orders/ByCountAndLines[].QuantityReducedBycompany` index. Then add the `orders/396-A` and `orders/445-A` documents.
The result is shown in Figure 11.6

![Showing 600 mapped entries for `companies/1-A`](./Ch11/img06.png)

This is very similar to how it looked before, and indeed, the structure of the data is exactly the same. This is because the
number of entries for `companies/1-A` is still quite small. Let's select another pair of documents, this time belonging to
`companies/77-A` and see what kind of structure we have there. Add `orders/77-A` and `orders/146-A` to the visualizer and 
take a look at the results, as shown in Figure 11.7.

![MapReduce works as a tree once we have enough entries for a particular value](./Ch11/img07.png)

On the left in Figure 11.7, you can see that, unlike for `companies/1-A` in Figure 11.6 where we had a flat list, Figure 11.7
shows a tree structure. Indeed, once we're past a certain size, RavenDB will start processing MapReduce entries in a treelike fashion.

Consider an update to `orders/77-A` and how RavenDB will apply it. First, we'll run the `map` on the updated document, giving
us the map entry to write to `#1028`. Then, we'll run the reduce on that page, giving us the final tally for this page. We'll
then recurse upward, toward `#1437`, where we'll also run the reduce.

The end result is that an update operation will take us a single `map` invocation and two `reduce` calls to update the final
result for `companies/77-A`. In other words, if we have a lot of data for a particular key, RavenDB will start segmenting
this data and apply aggregation operations in such a way that reduces the number of operations required to a minimum. This ensures
that we're not only able to answer queries efficiently but are also able to update the MapReduce results with very little 
costs.

### Defining your own MapReduce indexes

We've seen from Listing 11.1 how we can query using `group by` and RavenDB will generate a MapReduce index for us behind the 
scenes. This works quite nicely, but there's only so much that you can do with a dynamic query before the query optimizer will
give up.

The query optimizer can do quite a lot, but in order to make sure that it's predictable, it's currently limited to recognizing 
and being able to generate MapReduce indexes from a fairly small list of predictable patterns. For more complex things, you'll 
need to create your own MapReduce index. Luckily, this is easy to do.

Let's say we want to get the total number of sales and the total amount we made on each product. We can't express this as 
a simple query, so we'll need to create an MapReduce index of our own for that. Go to the `Indexes` page and click on 
`New Index`. Name the index `Products/Sales`, then click the `Add Reduction` button. Listing 11.3 has the contents of the `Map` 
and `Reduce` fields. After you're done filling these in, click `Save` to create the new index.

```{caption="Compute total number of sales and revenue per product" .cs}
// map 
from o in docs.Orders
from l in o.Lines
select new
{
    l.Product,
    l.Quantity,
    Total = (l.Quantity * l.PricePerUnit) * (1 - l.Discount)
}


// reduce
from r in results
group r by r.Product into g
select new
{
    Product = g.Key,
    Quantity = g.Sum(x=>x.Quantity),
    Total = g.Sum(x=>x.Total)
}
```

Before we get to investigating how this index works, let's talk about what it does. The map portion runs over all the orders and 
all the line items for each order. Then, for each of the line items, we output an entry with the quantity sold and the amount
of money we made on this product. The reduce will group all these results based on the `Product` field and then sum up all the 
final numbers for the `Total` and `Quantity` sold. 

Now that we've really seen `map` and `reduce`, it should be easier to grasp how they're truly two separate
operations. It's also important to understand that we aren't actually running the `map` or the `reduce` on the full results 
all the time. Instead, we break it apart internally and apply them to portions of the data each time. This leads to several 
important restrictions on MapReduce indexes:

* Both the `map` and `reduce` functions must be _pure_ functions. In other words, they should have no external input, and 
  calling them with the same input must always return the same output. In particular, usage of `Random` or `DateTime.Now` and
  similar calls is not allowed. 
* The output of the `map` is fed into the `reduce`. This should be obvious, but what may not be obvious is that the output of 
  the `reduce` is _also_ fed into the `reduce`, recursively. In particular, you should make no assumptions in the `reduce` about
  the number of calls or the amount of data that you have to process in each invocation to `reduce`. 
* The output of the `reduce` must match the output of the `map`. (Because both are being fed back into the `reduce`, they must
  have the same structure.) RavenDB will error if you have a different shape for each of the functions.

Because of these restrictions, RavenDB can apply the `map` and `reduce` functions in an incremental fashion and generate the 
results that we've already seen. This is the key to RavenDB's ability to compute aggregation cheaply over time.

We can now run the query in Listing 11.4 to find the top grossing products:

```{caption="Finding the top grossing products across all orders" .sql}
from index 'Products/Sales'
order by Total as double desc
```

You'll note that the results of this query are instantaneous. Even though we have tens of thousands of records, 
RavenDB only needs to look through 77 precomputed results. We can also sort by `Quantity` to find the most popular products. 

Go into the `Map-Reduce Visualizer` and select the `Products/Sales` index. Then, enter `orders/6-A` and `orders/10-A` to
see the internal structure of the MapReduce index, as shown in Figure 11.8.

![Internal structure of the `Products/Sales` index in the MapReduce visualizer](./Ch11/img08.png)

As you can see in Figure 11.8, all of the entries are big enough to require a tree structure. If you look at
`products/39-A`, you can see that this is holding just over 80,000 entries, with Figure 11.9 zooming in on a single page inside
that tree.

![A single page holding over 25,000 map entries, due to high compression rate](./Ch11/img09.png)

Page `#578` holds over 25,000 entries for this product. How can a single page hold so many? The answer is that RavenDB will 
apply compression to the mapped entries. Since they're mostly similar, they have a high compression rate, allowing
us to pack a _lot_ of entries in a small amount of space. This also adds to performance of the updating entries in the tree,
since we don't have to do as much work and the depth of the tree is much smaller.

This is about as low-level as we'll get when discussing the MapReduce implementation. You should now have a good feel for the relative costs of using aggregation in general&mdash;and MapReduce in particular&mdash;in RavenDB. With that 
knowledge under your belt, let's explore some of the more interesting things that we can do with MapReduce indexes in RavenDB.

#### Common pitfalls with MapReduce indexes

Certain operations are not easy to perform using the limits on the `map` and `reduce` functions that RavenDB has. Probably the 
most obvious example here is the problem with calculating an average. Let's edit the `Products/Sales` index to add an average.
Listing 11.5 shows the updated definition with the most obvious (and wrong) way to do so:

```{caption="Computing average (wrongly) in map-reduce index" .cs}
// map 
from o in docs.Orders
from l in o.Lines
select new
{
    l.Product,
    l.Quantity,
    Count = 1,
    Total = (l.Quantity * l.PricePerUnit) * (1 - l.Discount),
    Average = 0, // so we'll have the same shape as the reduce
    Debug = new object[0] // same shape as reduce
}


// reduce
from r in results
group r by r.Product into g
select new
{
    Product = g.Key,
    Quantity = g.Sum(x=>x.Quantity),
    Count = g.Sum(x=>x.Count),
    Total = g.Sum(x=>x.Total),
    Average = g.Average(x=>x.Total),
    Debug = g.Select(x=>x.Total).ToArray()
}
```

Save the updated index and then run the following query: `from index 'Products/Sales' where Product = 'products/1-A'`. 
The result is showed in Figure 11.10.

![The wrong results shown for an average computation](./Ch11/img10.png)

The results shown in Figure 11.10 are wrong. The average price for a box of chai (which is what `products/1-A` is) is not 
$184,514.014. So why are we getting this result? 

The answer is simple. The `Average` call isn't complex: it sums the elements that it got and then divides that by the number of elements. But remember that `map` and `reduce` calls are not called on each individual value. Instead, they're called in batches. This means by the time the final call to `reduce` 
happened, it didn't get a flat list of all the results. Instead, it got an aggregated list. Figure 11.11 shows the `Debug` field from
the index, which can allow us to better understand what's going on.

![The debug field from the `Products/Sales` index demonstrating the recursive nature of `reduce` operations](./Ch11/img11.png)

As you can see, the computation of the `Average` is correct for the input that it got. Because we executed the `reduce` multiple
times, by the time the final round came, we fed it seven results, each of them aggregating about 500 documents. In other words, when we write a MapReduce index, we need to take into account the fact that we never have access to the total
result set. This make sense, when you think about it. You don't want to have a single function invocation that has to go through
many tens of thousands of documents (or many more, on realistic datasets).

> **Don't assume that the order is fixed, either**
>
> If your MapReduce index does work that relies on the order of operations or the order of items passed to the `map` or 
> `reduce` function, it's going to fail in a similar manner. This is common when you have calls to `First` or use
> arrays in the MapReduce index. If you care about the order of operations, you'll need to ensure it as part of
> the MapReduce index and remember that the calls are made in a recursive manner. 

So how _can_ we compute an average? The answer is "quite simply." You can see it in Listing 11.6.

```{caption="Properly computing average in a map-reduce index" .cs}
// reduce
from r in results
group r by r.Product into g
let qty = g.Sum(x=>x.Quantity)
let total = g.Sum(x=>x.Total)
select new
{
    Product = g.Key,
    Quantity = qty,
    Count = g.Sum(x=>x.Count),
    Total = total,
    Average = total / qty
}
```

All we need to do for the proper computation is make sure we aren't assuming the total dataset is passed to the
`reduce` call. In this case, we already have all the data we need, and we can just compute the final average. Note that we'll
still need to have a field called `Average` in the `map` function because the shape must match. But since we're never reading
this field, we don't have to give it any special value and can just initialize it to any value we want.

Similarly to `Average`, we can't use `Count` in the `reduce` either, for the exact same reason. That's why we use `Count = 1` 
in the `map`: to allow us to start the recursive computation of the total amount of items.

#### Complex MapReduce indexes

So far, the MapReduce indexes we've built were pretty simple, mostly doing trivial aggregation on numbers. To be fair, that's 
usually what you'll do with MapReduce indexes. But you can also do more with them.

A good example would be to compute the total sales per company. This sounds like just taking the `Products/Sales` index and 
changing what we're grouping on, so let's make this more interesting. What we want to do is to get, per company, the total 
sales per product. 

Listing 11.7 shows the `Companies/Purchases` index, which does just that.

```{caption="Computing the total products sold for each company" .cs}
//map
from o in docs.Orders
from l in o.Lines
select new
{
    o.company,
    Products = new []{ new { l.Product, l.Quantity } },
    Total = l.Quantity
}

//reduce
from r in results
group r by r.company into g
select new
{
    company = g.Key,
    Products = g.SelectMany(x=>x.Products)
        .GroupBy(x=>x.Product)
        .Select(p => new
        {
            Product = p.Key,
            Quantity = p.Sum(x=>x.Quantity)
        }),
    Total = g.Sum(x=>x.Total)
}
```

Looking at Listing 11.7, we can see that the `map` function looks pretty normal, but there's a considerable amount of 
work going on in the `reduce`. Let's break it apart into its components and examine each independently.

First, the `map` generates an entry per line item, and the entry contains a single element `Products` array with the product's 
ID and the amount sold. The reason we create the array in the map is that we need to match the shape of the `reduce`. In the
`reduce` function, we group the results by the `company` and then generate the results for that particular company. The most
interesting tidbit happens when building the `Products` field. 

There, we apply _another_ `GroupBy` call to aggregate the data inside the `company` once again. We use this to get the total
numbers of items purchased for each product, and this mechanism allows us to aggregate the data across multiple invocations to
`reduce` safely and in a natural manner.

Now, let's see what this index actually generates. Execute the following query: 
`from index 'Companies/Purchases' where company ='companies/13-A'` and observe its results. You can also see this in 
Figure 11.12.

![Complex output form the index, showing aggregation inside the reduced result](./Ch11/img12.png)

This kind of index can be used to prepare complex computations ahead of time, leaning on RavenDB's ability to compute this beforehand. RavenDB will then be in charge of keeping such details up to date, and your client code can simply query the 
output of the index. 

### Querying MapReduce indexes

When talking about MapReduce indexes, we typically focus on the MapReduce portion of them&mdash;the aggregation and computation being done. This, however, is only part of the story. While a lot of stuff is going on in the MapReduce portion of the index,
in the end, the data is still being written to the index in exactly the same way as we've seen in the previous chapter. 

This means that you can execute any of the usual operations you would normally run. As a good example, let's look at 
Figure 11.12. The output of the query is pretty bare bones: what _is_ `products/21-A`, for example. Listing 11.8 shows a nice 
way to get more information at very little cost.

```{caption="Using functions to enrich the results from a map-reduce index" .sql}
declare function addProductName(result){
    for(var i = 0; i < result.Products.length; i++){
        var p = load(result.Products[i].Product);
        result.Products[i].ProductName = p.Name;
    }
    return result;
}
from index 'Companies/Purchases' as result
where result.company ='companies/13-A'
select addProductName(result)
```

The result of the query in Listing 11.8 is shown in Listing 11.9.

```{caption="Output of the query in Listing 11.8, showing enriched result set of map-reduce index" .js}
{
    "company": "companies/13-A",
    "Products": [
        {
            "Product": "products/21-A",
            "Quantity": 1010,
            "ProductName": "Sir Rodney's Scones"
        },
        {
            "Product": "products/37-A",
            "Quantity": 101,
            "ProductName": "Gravad lax"
        }
    ],
    "Total": 1111
}
```

The query in Listing 11.8 should serve as a nice example of the kind of things we can do, but it's just the first taste. In 
addition to using projections in this manner, you can also define MapReduce fields to support full text search, apply 
suggestions and "more like this." 

You can even query using facets on MapReduce indexes, an example of which you can see in Listing 11.10.

```{caption="Facets also apply to map-reduce indexes" .sql}
from index 'Companies/Purchases'
select facet(
    Total < 5000, 
    Total between 5_000 and 9_999,
    Total between 10_000 and 24_999,
    Total between 25_000 and 49_999,
    Total between 50_000 and 74_999,
    Total > 75_000,
    avg(Total)
    )
```

Applying facets, which can do their own aggregation, to MapReduce is an interesting experience. It allows us to do things like build a MapReduce operation to aggregate some of the data in a static fashion, then allow
faceted queries to slice and dice it further. If you look at the results of the query in Listing 11.10, you'll note that
the faceted results also include an average value for each facet, and we have support for the usual (`min`,
`max`, `sum`, `avg`) aggregation methods. 

In fact, that's not the only way to aggregate the data in multiple ways. There's also recursive MapReduce operations.

### Recursive MapReduce

In our Northwind example, we have orders representing sales to companies. This is the typical e-commerce model and should be
pretty familiar to you. A common requirement in such a system is reporting&mdash;in particular, pulling sales data on a daily, monthly
and yearly basis. 

Listing 11.11 shows the `Products/DailySales` index, which gives us the details of sales by product by day. 

```{caption="Computing total daily sales by product for all orders" .cs}
//map 
from o in docs.Orders
from l in o.Lines
select new 
{
    o.OrderedAt.Date,
    l.Product,
    Count = l.Quantity
}

//reduce
from r in results
group r by new { r.Date, r.Product } into g
select new
{
    g.Key.Date,
    g.Key.Product,
    Count = g.Sum(x=>x.Count)
}
```

The output of the `Products/DailySales` index can be seen in Figure 11.13. The only new thing we have in Listing 11.11 is the
`group by` on multiple fields, the `Date` and the `Product`.

![Showing the daily sales for each product on May 6th, 1998](./Ch11/img13.png)

Next, we need to compute the same values per month and then per year. We can define the same index again and run the exact
same computation but this time group by the product, year and month and then just by the product and year. But we currently
have over 83,000 orders in the database, and we'll likely have more. Doing the same operation on all these values again and
again seems...inefficient. 

RavenDB supports the notion of outputting a MapReduce output to the index and to a dedicated collection. Set the 
`Output reduce to collection` to `DailyProductSales`. Figure 11.14 shows how this can be done. 

![Configuring MapReduce index to write the output of the index to a dedicated collection](./Ch11/img14.png)

Make the modification to the `Products/DailySales` index and save it. Then head to the `Documents` tab and look at the 
collections in the database. You can see the results in Figure 11.15.

![Artificial documents created as a result of a MapReduce's output collection](./Ch11/img15.png)

In many respects, these artificial documents will behave just like standard documents. You can load them,
query them and even save modifications to them. Note that modifying an artificial document by hand 
is _not_ recommended. The next update  to the index will overwrite any changes you make to the document,
after all. Artificial documents are _not_ replicated. Since they're being created by the index directly,
they'll also be created in the remote node, so there's no point in sending them 
over the wire. 

Artificial documents are updated whenever the index completes a batch of documents, so there's very little
lag time between the index picking up changes and the artificial documents update. If this were the only
thing artificial documents were good for, that wouldn't be of much use. After all, we already have
the results as the output of the MapReduce index. So why do we need artificial documents?

The primary reason that artificial documents exist is so you can set up indexes on top of them. And that
includes _additional MapReduce indexes_. Take a look at Listing 11.12, showing just such an example of
the `Products/MonthlySales` index, computing the monthly totals from the daily totals.


```{caption="Recursive map-reduce index using artificial documents" .cs}
//map 
from ds in docs.DailyProductSales
select new 
{
    ds.Product,
    Year =  ds.Date.Year,
    Month = ds.Date.Month,
    ds.Count
}

//reduce
from result in results
group result by new 
{ 
    result.Product, 
    result.Year, 
    result.Month 
}
into g
select new
{
    g.Key.Year,
    g.Key.Month,
    g.Key.Product,
    Count = g.Sum(x=>x.Count)
    
}
```

You can see that the `map` of the `Products/MonthlySales` index is using the `DailyProductSales` 
collection as it source, and the `reduce` aggregates the data by product on a monthly basis. Let's examine
what's actually going on here in a little more depth.

Whenever an order is created or modified, the `Products/DailySales` index will run, computing the updated 
daily totals for the products in the new order. As a result of this index running, artificial documents will
be created (with IDs such as `DailyProductSales/3183876884104958208`) with the result of the MapReduce index.

Because a `DailyProductSales` document was created, the `Products/MonthlySales` index will run on the changed daily
tallies to update its own numbers. We can even set things up so we'll have an output collection for the 
`MonthlyProductsSales` as well, and then define a `Products/YearlySales`. The recursive nature of the indexing naturally
extends in this manner. 

Artificial documents do have a few limitations that you should be aware of:

* RavenDB will detect and generate an error if you have a cycle of artificial documents. In other words, you can't
  define another index that will output artificial documents if that will trigger (directly or indirectly) the 
  same index. Otherwise, you might set up a situation where the indexes run in an infinite loop. 
* You must choose an empty collection. RavenDB will not allow you to output artificial documents into a preexisting
  collection. This is done because RavenDB will overwrite any document in the collection, so it prevents the option
  of overwriting existing documents. 
* The document identifiers for the artificial documents are generated by RavenDB (based on the hash of the reduce 
  key), and you don't have any control over them.
* Artificial documents are not sent over replication and cannot use revisions.

Artificial documents and recursive MapReduce are a good match, but before you turn your RavenDB instances into a reporting 
powerhouse, there's another possible topology to consider. Instead of defining these indexes and processes on the 
main database, you can set up external replication to a dedicated database (on the same cluster or on a separate one) and run
all that work there. 

This can simplify distribution of work as the application grows. If you have many such indexes and a high rate of 
changes, being able to isolate the work to a particular database group (and thus specific nodes) can be very helpful. 

### MultimapReduce indexes

In the previous chapter, Figure 10.12 demonstrated the usage of multimap indexes to index several collections and 
unite the results into a single index. This can be great for when you want to search over several things at the same
time. The example we looked at in Chapter 10 searched for a person by name, where the person can be an `Employee`, a 
`Contact` on a `company` or a `Contact` for a `Supplier`. Regardless, we were able to search for that person easily
and in a convenient manner.

MultimapReduce indexes allow us to extend that behavior to also include aggregation across multiple sources
in a natural way. Let's first look at Listing 11.13, showing off this feature, and then explore what this means.

Go to the `Indexes` page and create a new index. Click on `Add map` twice and create the three maps. Then click `Add Reduction` and add the reduce. Name the new index `Cities/Details` and click `Save`.

```{caption="Multimap-reduce index that sums the points of interest in each city" .cs}
// map #1
from c in docs.Companies
select new 
{
    c.Address.City,
    Companies = 1,
    Suppliers = 0,
    Employees = 0
}


// map #2
from s in docs.Suppliers
select new 
{
    s.Address.City,
    Companies = 0,
    Suppliers = 1,
    Employees = 0
}

// map 3
from e in docs.Employees
select new{
    e.Address.City,
    Companies = 0,
    Suppliers = 0,
    Employees = 1
}

//reduce
from result in results
group result by result.City 
into g
select new 
{
    City = g.Key,
    Companies = g.Sum(x=>x.Companies),
    Suppliers = g.Sum(x=>x.Suppliers),
    Employees = g.Sum(x=>x.Employees),
}
```

Take a few minutes to look at Listing 11.13. There's a lot of stuff going on there. We define three maps, on the 
`Companies`, `Suppliers` and `Employees`. And for each, we output a count for the type of the document we're mapping, as well as the relevant `City`. Finally, on the reduce, we simplify group by `City` and then sum up all the results 
from all the intermediate steps to get the final tally. Listing 11.14 shows the output from this index for London.

```{caption="Output of the `Cities/Details` index for London"}
{
    "City": "London",
    "Companies": 6,
    "Suppliers": 1,
    "Employees": 4
}
```

The `Cities/Details` index is interesting, in the sense that it shows off capabilities, but it isn't really that
exciting. It also operates on a small dataset, even if it touches multiple collections. Let's modify the index
by also having it operate on orders. 

> **MapReduce indexes are also just indexes**
>
> It bears repeating that a MapReduce index is also just an index. We focused heavily in this chapter on the MapReduce

We'll first add another entry for each of the existing maps `OrderTotal = 0`. And we'll add the same logic for the reduce
function: `OrderTotal = g.Sum(x=>x.OrderTotal)`. The first step is required because all the maps and reduces in an index
must have the same output. The second is required to actually sum up the information we'll shortly add. Now click on the 
`Add map` button on the index edit page and add the map shown in Listing 11.15.

```{caption="Adding total order per city to the `Cities/Details` index" .cs}
from o in docs.Orders
select new
{
    o.ShipTo.City,
    Companies = 0,
    Suppliers = 0,
    Employees = 0,
    OrderTotal =  o.Lines.Sum( 
        x => x.Quantity * x.PricePerUnit 
    )
}
```

We now have an index that can give us a lot of interesting details about each city. Listing 11.16 shows the updated 
output for London in the database. 

```{caption="London's information now includes the total revenue for orders shipped to it"}
{
    "City": "London",
    "Companies": 6,
    "Suppliers": 1,
    "Employees": 4,
    "OrderTotal": 4107034.71
}
```

As you can imagine, this kind of behavior is powerful because it allows you to pull data from disparate parts of your 
system and aggregate it with very little work. Querying this information is effectively free, so that also
makes it much easier to consume and work with. 

### Dynamic aggregation with MapReduce indexes

MapReduce indexes are a wonderful way to handle aggregation. RavenDB's ability to precompute and answer complex aggregation
cheaply can make a world of difference in your ability to deliver features in your applications. The fact that showing an
aggregated value doesn't require you to set up an off-hours job, monitor it, clear caches, etc. is a force multiplier for your
application's capabilities.

However, while the MapReduce operation can seem magical at times, it's a tool fit for a purpose. Trying to use it for
a different purpose than it's intended for will produce suboptimal results. MapReduce indexes are great when

* The fields you're aggregating by are known in advance.
* The source data you're aggregating is known in advance. 

In other words, MapReduce is great for static aggregation. If you want to get the daily totals by product, MapReduce is the 
perfect solution. The data source (all orders) is known. What you're aggregating by (the date and the product) is known in
advanced, too. RavenDB is able to generate the appropriate MapReduce operation, compute the result and allow you to query it easily and cheaply.

But what happens if we want to aggregate daily sales by product only for London? Well, that's easy. We can define another
MapReduce index that aggregates the results by date, product and city. We get the same benefits, and everyone is happy. But
the next request is to get the daily sales by city based on the supplier, not the product. And the _next_ request after that
is to aggregate the sales by the employee on a monthly basis, and the one after that is to see the yearly sales by product 
only for specific customers, and then...

I think you get the picture. MapReduce indexes are great when the type of aggregation is known in advance. In this case, 
RavenDB is able to prepare everything and have an answer ready for you by the time you query. But if your queries are 
dynamic and fluid, and if you're changing what you're querying on and how you're doing the aggregation, this is much more complex.

One option would be to define a MapReduce index for each type of aggregation you need. This works, but you might end up with
a _lot_ of MapReduce indexes. That can be fine. RavenDB is _very_ efficient in the handling of MapReduce indexes (they're typically _cheaper_ to run than a map-only index, actually), but a large number of indexes still means that we need to execute some amount of work times the number of indexes for each change. 

A better approach for dynamic aggregation is to use facets. To see the total sales for egg noodles and cheese in the first week
of July 1996, we can run the query in Listing 11.17.

```{caption="Using facets on top of a map-reduce index to achieve dynamic aggregation" .sql}
from index 'Products/DailySales'
where Date between '1996-07-01' and '1996-07-07' 
and   Product in ('products/11-A', 'products/42-A')
select facet(Product, sum(Count))
```

Let's break the query in Listing 11.17 apart, one clause at a time. First, we select the MapReduce index `Products/DailySales`,
which we've already seen in Listing 11.11. The `where` clause specifies the date range we want to query and the particular products
we're interested in. Note that the `Date` query is using `between` and relies on the fact that we do lexical comparisons to
get a clear syntax for the date range. 

The `select` clause is using facets, but unlike the facets queries we looked at in the previous chapter, we're now adding
a new wrinkle in the form of `sum(Count)`. This allows us to do an aggregation operation over the query results. In this way, we can dynamically control
what will be aggregated.

The result of the faceted query is affected by the matches for the query, and that can change dynamically with very little 
cost, opening the way to more dynamic aggregation queries. Dynamic aggregation also has a pretty straightforward cost, since
it's linear to the amount of matches for the query. 

That's a great thing since it simplifies dynamic queries. But it also means that if you want to run a faceted query with 
aggregation on a very large result set, it's going to take time to process. A MapReduce on the same (or much larger) amount
of data will be much faster at querying time, but it's limited in the amount of flexibility it allows for each query.

Combining MapReduce and facets to handle this is a great way to reduce^[Pun very much intended here.] the amount of data the
facets need to go through. It's easiest to consider this kind of approach as feeding the facets baby food, already pre-chewed. 
That dramatically cuts down the amount of effort required to get the final result.

### Multi-step aggregation processes

We've looked at all sorts of MapReduce indexes in this chapter, and we also looked at how we can use dynamic aggregation to 
build dynamic aggregated queries. Now I want to apply all that knowledge to a more complex example, utilizing many of the 
features we explored in this chapter. 

Here's the requirement: we want to be able to get a monthly report of sales by supplier per city. It might be easier to understand
if we start from the point of view of the user interface. Take a look at Figure 11.16, which shows a mockup of the search
interface and the results we want to see. 

![Mockup of the user interface for the kind of data we want](./Ch11/img16.png)

The simplest way to be able to answer this query is to use `LoadDocument` in the map phase of the index. You can see how 
this is done in Listing 11.18.

```{caption="Map-reduce index using `LoadDocument` can pull data from related documents" .cs}
//map
from o in docs.Orders
from l in o.Lines
let product = LoadDocument(l.Product, "Products")
select new
{
    o.ShipTo.City,
    o.ShippedAt.Month,
    o.ShippedAt.Year,
    Supplier =  product.Supplier,
    Total = l.PricePerUnit * l.Quantity
}
// reduce
from result in results
group result by new 
{ 
    result.City, 
    result.Supplier,
    result.Month,
    result.Year
} 
into g
select new 
{
    g.Key.City,
    g.Key.Supplier,
    g.Key.Month,
    g.Key.Year,
    Total = g.Sum(x=>x.Total)
}
```

The interesting bit in Listing 11.18 is the `LoadDocument` call in the map. Everything else is pretty much the same as we've
done throughout this chapter. We looked at `LoadDocument` in the previous chapter, and it serves mostly the same role in 
MapReduce indexes as well. If the product document has changed, we'll have to re-index all the documents that referenced it. 
Because of this, the `LoadDocument` option is only available during the map phase of a MapReduce index. You can't call 
`LoadDocument` from the reduce.

A sample query for this index can be seen in Listing 11.19.

```{caption="This query can be used to render the results in Figure 11.16." .sql}
from index 'Sales/ByCityAndSupplier' as t
where t.City= 'London' and t.Month = 2 and t.Year = 1997
order by t.Total as double desc
load t.Supplier as s
select s.Name, t.City, t.Supplier , t.Month, t.Year, t.Total
```

This works. It generates the results you see in Figure 11.16. However, there's a problem here. `LoadDocument` requires
that RavenDB will update the index if the referenced document (the product's document, in this case) is updated. This means that
an update to a product can force RavenDB to re-index all the orders that have this product. If it's a popular product, this
may require RavenDB to re-index a large number of orders.

Ideally, we want to have `LoadDocument` where the number of referencing documents is bounded and small. Is there a better way
to handle this? We can change the index in Listing 11.18 so it doesn't include the `Supplier`, and instead groups things
only by the (product, city, month, year). We'll also define an output collection for the results.
The output collection is then used in another index where we'll use a `LoadDocument` to achieve the same output. 

Why all of this complexity? Aren't we in exactly the same position as we were before? An update to a product document will 
force us to re-index, after all. And the answer is yes, it will force us to re-index, but the question is _what_. In the case
of Listing 11.18, any change to a product will force re-indexing of all the `Orders` documents that referenced it. But in
the case where we had an intermediate artificial documents collection, we'll only need to re-index those that referenced the
modified product. 

Those documents have already gone through a MapReduce process, and there are likely to be far fewer of them than there are 
orders, so this is a net win in terms of the total amount of work that has to be done.

### Summary

This chapter covered a _lot_ of ground. I tried to strike the right balance between giving you enough information about what's
actually going on behind the scenes and drowning everything in implementation details. 

The key takeaway I hope you'll get from this chapter is that aggregation in RavenDB is cheap and plentiful, so
have at it. This is in direct contrast to the way things usually work with other databases. Aggregation is often expensive and 
hard, so it gets pushed to dedicated solutions (nightly runs, reporting databases, cached queries, etc.). None of this is 
needed with RavenDB.

We started this chapter by writing some simple RQL queries using `group by`, and it just worked. The query optimizer recognized
the query and generated the appropriate MapReduce index, and we were off to the races. We then took a deep, hard look at what was
actually going on there, analyzing what the index was doing and how MapReduce works inside RavenDB.

In order to better understand that, RavenDB has a few tools built in to help you. Chief among them is the MapReduce visualizer,
which lets you peek deep into the heart of how RavenDB executes MapReduce operations. We looked at the different behaviors that
happen when we have a small amount of items to aggregate for a particular reduce key (all items are reduced in a single group)
and when we have a very large amount of items (reduce is handled in a recursive tree fashion). 

This means that updates to MapReduce indexes are very fast because we usually need to do a minimal amount of work to get the
updated results.
After learning how RavenDB processes MapReduce indexes, we learned how we can define our own, with complete
freedom of how we want to structure the data and aggregate it.
 
We also learned there are also some things to remember when you build your indexes, such as making sure that the `map` and `reduce` functions are
pure, that your `reduce` function can handle being called recursively and that the `reduce` outputs less data than we put in.

We then upped the ante and looked at more complex MapReduce indexes, grouping all the results by company. Inside each company, we
grouped things again by product to get a detailed summary of the results. These kinds of indexes can allow you to do sophisticated
aggregation, rollups and computation during the indexing. Then they expose the whole thing, readily consumable, to your application.

MapReduce indexes can do amazing things, but they're also indexes in RavenDB. That means that, in addition to whatever you're doing in the MapReduce operation, all the usual stuff you can do with indexes is also there. We looked at how we can use
JavaScript projections to enrich the MapReduce output during query, use facets on the data (including additional aggregation)
and the many more options (full text search, spatial, etc.).

If a single MapReduce index isn't enough, you can always try things recursively. Indeed, RavenDB allows MapReduce indexes to
output artificial documents back to the database, and these documents are a key part of allowing RavenDB to handle recursive
MapReduce indexes. We looked at how we can do a daily and monthly rollup of sales per product by creating a MapReduce index
that's fed off the artificial documents collection that's created by another MapReduce index. This opens up the option to do
some really cool things because you can pipeline the work and take advantage of what's already been done.

Another cool option we looked at was the ability to use MultimapReduce indexes. Instead of just aggregating data from a single
collection, we can aggregate the data from several of them at once. That allows you to, with very little effort, paint a picture of what's actually
going on in your database and gain insight into what you're doing. We saw a good example
of that when we looked at what was going on in each city and were able to tell how many companies, employees, suppliers and
sales we had in each location. 

MapReduce is fantastic when you have a static aggregation scenario&mdash;when you know what you're aggregating ahead of time.
Otherwise, you'll need to (either directly or via the query optimizer) generate MapReduce indexes for each permutation
that you want to query. Another alternative to that is the notion of dynamic aggregation, using facets to slice and dice the 
information dynamically. This tends to be less efficient than a MapReduce index, but it has less upfront costs.

It's common to do that in two stages: first defining the rough shape of the aggregation in a MapReduce index, efficiently 
doing the aggregation, and then using facets and dynamic aggregation on that much smaller result set to narrow down things
more accurately. This gives you both fast aggregations and more flexibility in the queries.

We finished the chapter by looking at aggregating documents by a _related_ document, using `LoadDocument` in a MapReduce
index. This works, and it can be quite an elegant solution for some scenarios. But it's also possible to get into trouble with
this approach because an update to a referenced document requires re-indexing of all the referencing documents. Instead, we
can utilize artificial documents and two MapReduce indexes to reduce the amount of work required when we need to
re-index.

The MapReduce engine inside RavenDB is very flexible, and it's been used to great effect over the years&mdash;including in many 
scenarios that surprised development teams. Aggregation of results is only the most obvious of the options
that are available to you.

In the next chapter, we'll switch gears a bit and move to a more practical mindset, talking about how to utilize and work with
indexes in your applications.
