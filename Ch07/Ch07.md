## Scaling Distributed Work in RavenDB

[Distributed Deep Dive]:(#clustering-deep-dive)

In the previous chapter, we covered a lot. We went over how RavenDB clusters and database groups work. We looked at the nitty-gritty details, such as conflicts and change vectors. And we saw how a cluster can handle failover and recovery. But we haven't talked about how to actually make use of a cluster. This is primarily what we'll cover in this chapter: how to properly utilize your RavenDB cluster to best effect.

We'll cover how to grow your cluster to include a large number of nodes, how to host a _lot_ of databases in the cluster, how we can automatically have the cluster adjust the nodes a database resides on, which will ensure a minimum number of replicas, and how we can deploy RavenDB in a geo-distributed environment.

But first, we need to go back a bit and discuss the distributed mechanisms in RavenDB&mdash;the cluster and the database group. The separation RavenDB makes between 
a cluster and a database group can be artificial. If you're running a single database on all your nodes, you usually
won't make any distinction between the cluster as a whole and the database group. This distinction starts to become much more important if you're working
in a system that utilizes many databases.

The simplest example for such a system is a microservice architecture. Each microservice in your system has its own database group that's running on the 
cluster, and you can define the number of nodes each database group will run on. This tends to be easier to manage, deploy and work with than having a separate
cluster per microservice. 

Another example of a situation where you'll have multiple databases is multitenancy, where each tenant gets its own separate database. This makes it simple to deal
with tenant separation, and you can adjust the number of nodes per tenant easily. This approach will also allow you to scale your system in a way that's convenient. As you have 
more tenants, you can just add more machines to the cluster and spread the load among them. 

That said, note there's a certain cost for running each database instance. It's usually easier for RavenDB to have a single large database than many small ones. The general rule of thumb is that you shouldn't host more than a hundred or so active databases per machine.

### Growing your cluster

RavenDB is using Raft as the underlying consensus protocol for managing the cluster. The [Raft Paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) is a truly impressive 
read, mostly because the paper manages to make one of the hardest tasks in distributed programming understandable. I highly recommend reading it, even if
you never intend to dig into the details of how RavenDB or other distributed systems do their magic. 

The simplest way to explain how Raft works is that the cluster makes decisions based on majority confirmation. This quick explanation does a great injustice to both the algorithm and
the Raft Paper, but it simplifies things enough for us to reason about them without deviating _too_ much from what's really going on. Majority confirmation is defined
as having a particular value on `N/2+1` of the nodes, using integer math and assuming that `N` is the number of nodes. In other words, if your cluster size is
three, then a majority would be two. Any value that was confirmed by any two nodes is considered committed.

Table 7.1 shows the majority calculation for several common cluster sizes. Note that even numbers have the same majority as the odd number preceding them. Because of that,
you'll typically have an odd number of nodes in your cluster. 

| Cluster size | Majority |
|--------------|----------|
|            2 |        2 |
|            3 |        2 |
|            4 |        3 |
|            5 |        3 |
|            7 |        4 |
|            9 |        5 |
|           15 |        8 |
|           21 |       11 |
|           51 |       26 |

Table 7.1: Majorities for different-sized clusters

This majority behavior has a few very interesting implications you should consider. First, you'll note that if we had a failure condition that 
took out more than half of our cluster, the cluster as a whole will not be able to make any decisions (even while individual database instances will operate
normally). In a cluster of five nodes, if there aren't any three nodes that can communicate with each other, there's no way to reach any decisions. 

On the other hand, the more nodes there are in your cluster, the more network traffic making a decision will generate. In pathological cases, such as a 
cluster size of 51, you'll need to contact at least 26 servers to reach any decisions. That's going to impose a high latency requirement on anything the cluster is doing. 

In practice, you rarely grow the cluster beyond seven members or so. The cost of doing that is usually too high. At that point, you'll either set up 
multiple independent clusters or use a different method. The cluster size we mentioned is for voting members in the cluster, but the cluster doesn't
have to contain only voting members. We can just add nodes to the cluster as watchers.

These nodes don't take part in the majority calculations and are only there to watch what's going on in the cluster. As far as RavenDB is concerned, they're
full-blown members in the cluster. They can be assigned databases and work to be done, but we aren't going to include them in the hot path of making decisions 
in the cluster.

Using this approach, you can decide that three or five nodes in your cluster are the voting members and all the rest are just watchers. This gives us the ability to 
make decisions with a majority of only three nodes while the actual size of the cluster can be much higher. Of course, if a majority of the cluster's voting members are unable to talk to one another (because they're down or because the network failed, say) then the cluster as a whole will not be available.

Figure 7.1 shows a cluster using three member nodes and two watchers. Node E is the leader, and it's managing all of the nodes. Creating a database on this cluster
will cause it to allocate database instances to both member nodes and watcher nodes, but the cluster leaders can only be nodes A, B or E. If two of them are down,
the cluster as a whole will also be down, and you'll not be able to perform cluster operations (but your databases will function normally otherwise.)

![A cluster with members and watchers](./Ch07/img01.png)

A cluster being unavailable doesn't usually impact ongoing database operations. The actual topology at scale is something the operations team
needs to consider. A single large cluster is usually easier to manage, and the cluster can add as many watchers as you need to handle the load you're going to 
put on it. The databases themselves don't care what node they run on, whether they're voting members or just watchers. And the cluster can manage database 
instance assignments across all machines with ease. 

### Mutliple data centers and geo-distribution

It's easy to reason about RavenDB's distributed behavior when you're running on the local network or in the same data center, but what about when you have 
multiple data centers? And what about when you have geo-distributed data centers? Those are important considerations for the architecture of the system.
Because there are so many possible deployment options, I'm going to use AWS as the canonical example, simply because there's so much information about it. You should be able to adapt the advice here to your needs easily enough, even if you aren't using AWS.

Inside the same availability zone (same data center) in Amazon, you can expect ping times of less than a millisecond. Between two availability zones in the same region (separate
data centers^[Note: this assumes the connection between those data centers doesn't go over the public internet but rather dedicated lines. If the connection between
the data centers is over the public internet, expect higher latency and more variance in the timings.] that are very close by), you'll typically see ping times 
that are in the single-digit millisecond range. 

The default configuration for the RavenDB cluster is each node expects to get a heartbeat from the cluster leader every 300 ms. When running in the same data
center, that's typically not a problem unless there's a failure of the leader (or the network), in which case the cluster as a whole will select a new leader.
However, what happens when we start talking about geo-distributed data centers? Let's use Table 7.2 as a discussion point. 


|  Data center  |      Tag       |
|---------------|----------------|
| N. Virginia   | us-east-1      |
| Ohio          | us-east-2      |
| N. California | us-west-1      |
| London        | eu-west-2      |
| Singapore     | ap-southeast-1 |

Table: A few AWS data centers and their locations

Ping times^[The ping times between these data centers were taken from [cloudping.co](https://www.cloudping.co/).] between these data centers are quite
different. For example, N. Virginia to Ohio is 30 ms, and N. Virginia to N. California is already at around 70 ms. N. California to London is twice that at 140 ms,
and Singapore to N. Virginia clocks in at 260 ms.

Given that the default configuration calls for an election if we didn't hear from the leader in 300 ms, it's clear that you can't just throw a cluster with one node each in N. Virginia, Singapore and London. The network latency alone would mean we'd be unable to proceed in most cases. However,
that's just the default configuration and is easily changed. The reason I'm dedicating so much time to talking about latency here is that it has a huge effect on your systems that you should consider.

If you have the need to run in multiple data centers&mdash;or even in geo-distributed data centers&mdash;you need to think about the latency between them and what it
means for your application. There are two options you should consider. The first is having a data-center-spanning cluster. The second is to have a cluster
per data center. Let's review both of these options.

#### Single cluster, multiple data centers

When you have a single cluster spanning multiple data centers, take note of the expected latency and behavior. The actual configuration of the cluster
timeout is easy to set (the configuration option is `Cluster.ElectionTimeoutInMs`, defaulting to 300 ms), but that's the least interesting thing about this 
scenario.

When running in a geo-distributed cluster, you need to consider the various operations you use. The cluster timeout is merely the maximum amount of time the nodes will wait for a notification from the leader before deciding that there isn't one and an election needs to be held. If there's work the cluster needs to do, it won't wait for the timeout to happen. Instead, it will always execute it as fast as it can.

On the other hand, an excessively high timeout value means the cluster will take longer to detect that there's a failed leader and recover from that. In 
general, the cluster will typically recover from a failed node in up to three times the timeout value, so that needs to be taken into account. On the WAN, I'd 
suggest you raise the timeout to three to five seconds and see how stable that is for your environment. A lot of it will depend on the quality of the communication between
the various nodes in your cluster. 

We talked a lot so far about the cluster and the effect of latency on the cluster, but most of the time we're going to operate directly with the database, not the 
cluster. So how does running in a geo-distributed environment affect the database replication?

The answer is that it generally doesn't. The database-level replication was designed for WAN, and there aren't any hard timeouts like there is at the cluster level. The cluster
needs to know there's an active leader because, if there isn't, the node needs to step up and suggest itself as the next leader. But at the database level, all
nodes are equal. Any disruption in communication between the nodes is handled by merging the data from all the nodes at a later point in time, resolving
any conflicts that may have occurred. This means that a database group is much easier to deploy in a geo-distributed environment with high latency; the 
nodes are fine with delays. 

> **Database instance distribution in the multi-data-center cluster**
>
> RavenDB assumes that all nodes in a cluster are roughly equal to one another, and when you create a new database, it will assign instances of this database to nodes
> in the cluster, regardless of where they're located. If you're running in a multi-data-center cluster, you probably want to explicitly state which nodes this
> database will reside on so you can ensure they're properly divided between the different data centers.

Another consideration to take into account is that there's also the clients. A client running on the London data center that connects to the Singapore
node for all queries is going to suffer. By default, RavenDB assumes that all nodes are equal, and the cluster will arbitrarily choose a node in the database 
topology that we'll typically work with. 

In the previous chapter, we talked about load balancing and how we can ask RavenDB to handle that for us automatically. One of the options available for us there is
`FastestNode`. This option will make each client determine which node (or nodes) are the fastest, as far as it's concerned, and access them according to speed. This
mode, in a geo-distributed configuration, will result in each client talking to the node closest to it. 
That's usually the best deployment option for such an environment because you're both geo-distributed and able to access a local instance at LAN speeds. 

There's a potential problem to think about. When your system is composed of parts far enough apart that it can take hundreds of milliseconds to merely send a packet back 
and forth, there is the issue of consistency. If you're writing a document in one area, it's not guaranteed that you'll see the write in another area. In fact, you'll
always have to wait until that write has been replicated.

We talked about write assurances and `WaitForReplicationAfterSaveChanges` in the previous chapter, but it's very relevant here as well. After you make a write with the 
`FastestNode` option, the next session you open might access a different node. In order to ensure that the next request from the user will be able to read the write
the user just made, you need to call `WaitForReplicationAfterSaveChanges`. Alternatively, if this is a write for which a short delay in replicating to all other 
nodes is acceptable, you can skip it and avoid the need  for confirmation across the entire geo-distributed cluster.

#### Multiple clusters, multiple data centers

A single cluster spread over multiple data centers can be convenient for the operations team since there's just one cluster to manage everything. But it
can also create headaches. Using the data from Table 7.2 as an example, if we have two nodes in London and one node in N. Virginia, our leader will tend to always be based in London. Any outage 
between the two data centers will leave the cluster fully functioning in London and unable to complete anything in N. Virginia (since it can't reach the other side).

Another problem is that failover _between_ data centers is not something you'll want to do. You might want to fail _to_ another data center, but failing a web app from
the N. Virginia data center all the way to the one in London imposes a very high latency. If a page is making just eight database requests, it's going to take over a
second to answer render a single page. And that's just calculating the network round-trip costs. In such cases, it's often preferable to send the web traffic 
directly to the London data center until N. Virginia's is fully up again.

In such a scenario, having a single cluster will actually work against us. The problem is that the client API will automatically failover to any available node, but
in this case, we don't want that. We can't tell the client not to failover to nodes in our cluster. That doesn't make sense. The appropriate way to handle this is 
to create separate clusters, one in each data center. In this manner, each data center's cluster is independent and manages only its own nodes. The client API in each
data center is configured to point to the nodes in that data center only. 

In this case, because failover stops at the cluster boundary, there will be no failover between data centers. But we still need to deal with a tough problem. How 
are we going to handle sharing the data between the separate clusters? 

#### Sharing data between clusters

A RavenDB cluster is a standalone unit. It manages itself and doesn't concern itself much with the outside world. There are situations, however, where you want to
have data shared between multiple clusters. This can happen if you want an offsite replica of all your data or if you've decided to have different clusters in 
each data center rather than a single cross-data-center cluster.

> **A replica isn't a backup**
>
> It's tempting to think that an offsite replica is also going to serve as a backup and neglect to pay careful attention to the backup/restore portion of your
> database strategy. That would be a mistake. RavenDB's external replication support provides you with an offsite replica, but it doesn't present good solutions to many backup scenarios. It doesn't, for example, protect you from an accidental collection delete or tell you the state of the system at, say, 9:03 AM last Friday.

Setting up replication between clusters can be done easily because RavenDB makes a strong distinction between a cluster and database group interactions. 
In this case, this allows us to define a replication target that's not part of the cluster itself. We can do that in the database by going to `Settings`, `Manage Ongoing Tasks` and then adding an `External Replication` task. You'll need to provide the URL and database name for the destination. Then, save the
new replication. 
If you don't have an additional cluster to test this on, you can specify one of your own nodes and create a separate database to replicate to.

> On the face of it, it seems strange that we can set up an external replication from the cluster back to itself. Why make it an external replication, then?
> Well, this can be useful if you want a copy of the data that wouldn't be a failover target for the clients. It may be an offsite backup or just a dedicated database
> that's set up to do some kind of job (such as run ETL processes). 

Ongoing tasks in general are quite interesting, and we'll discuss that at length in the next section. For now, we'll focus on what the external replication feature means for us. Once we've finished configuring it, the cluster will assign one of the database group nodes to keep that replica up to date at all 
times.

It's important to remember that, at the database level, we treat it as just another destination. The cluster is _not_ managing it. That means that cluster-level behaviors&mdash;such as defining conflict resolvers, failover for the client or index replication&mdash;are not sent over. An external replica is just that: 
external. You can configure both the source cluster and the destination replica in the same manner, of course, but there's nothing that forces you to do so. In fact, 
the other common reason to set up an external replica is to have a _different_ configuration.

A good example of this is when you want to have expensive indexes and only run them on a particular machine. Maybe you need to run pricey analytics or to do
certain work on a specific location. Using external replication gives you the ability to control the flow of the data without also dictating how it's going to
be processed. 

What would it take to have an offsite replica for our cluster? It's quite easy. In the studio, go into `Settings`, then to `Manage ongoing tasks` and click
 `Add`. Choose `External Replication` and fill the URL and database name, and that's pretty much it. The cluster will assign that replication target
to one of the database instances in the database group, and it will immediately start replicating the data to the target.

It's important to understand that, for all intents and purposes, this is just the same replication that happens between different nodes in the same cluster. The
nodes don't know (or care) that this particular replication target isn't in their cluster. That's important to know because it means you can use all the 
replication features, including optimistic concurrency across disparate geo-distributed clusters.

External replication between two clusters will detect conflicts in editing the same documents in separate clusters and will resolve it according to each cluster
conflict resolution policy.^[The conflict resolution will then flow to the other cluster as well, so it's _highly_ recommended that you have the same policy
configuration on both clusters&mdash;that is, unless you have a specific reason not to, such as one-way replication or a meaningful difference in the tasks that the different
clusters perform in your system.]
Figure 7.2 shows the result of a cluster that has defined several external replications from the cluster, for various purposes.

![Several external replication tasks and their responsible nodes](./Ch07/img02.png)

In Figure 7.2, you can also see that the responsible node portion has been emphasized, and you can see the node tag responsible for keeping each replication
target up to date. You can also see that the cluster has assigned each external replication task to a separate node.^[The cluster will make that determination
on its own, and it may not always perfectly distribute the work among the nodes in this fashion. Overall, however, the work will be distributed among all the
nodes to create a rough equality of work]. 
We haven't discussed it yet, but that's one of the more important roles of the cluster: deciding what work goes where. 

### Ongoing tasks and work distribution

The cluster as we know it so far isn't really smart. It give us the ability to distribute configuration, such as what databases goes where, what indexes are 
defined, etc. But it doesn't _do_ much. But that's not actually a good representation of the way things are. It only seems this way because we've focused specifically on the flow of _data_ 
inside a database group rather than the flow of _work_. 

What does that mean, to have work assigned to a database group? The simplest example is the one we just talked about: external replication. If we have three nodes 
in this database group, which node will update the external replica? We don't want to have all three nodes do that. There's no real point in doing so, 
and it can cause unnecessary network traffic. Instead, the cluster will assign this work to one of the database instances, which will be responsible for keeping
the external replica up to date. 

Another example of what it means to have work assigned to a database group is an hourly incremental backup of your data, as well as a full backup on a weekly basis. You don't want to have this backup run on all three nodes at 
the same time. Beside the fact that this will increase the load on the system across the board, we don't really have any use for triplicate 
backups of the same data. This is where the work assignment portion of the cluster comes into play. 

Whenever there's a task for a database group to do, the cluster will decide which node will actually be responsible for it. That seems pretty simple, but there's
a bit more to the story. Assigning work is easy, but the cluster is also watching the nodes and checking how healthy they are. If a node is down, 
the cluster will reassign the work to another node for the duration. 

In the case of a backup, if the node that's responsible for it is down when the backup is scheduled, another will shoulder the load and make sure you don't have any gaps in your backups. In the case of external replication, another node will transparently take over keeping the external replica up to date 
with all the changes that happened in the database group. 

Another type of work in the cluster&mdash;one we've already talked about in this book&mdash;is subscriptions. The cluster will divide all the subscriptions between the various
nodes in the database group and reassign them on failure without your code needing to change anything (or typically even be aware of the failure). Other types of
work that we can define for the database group include ETL processes, which are covered in the next chapter. 

An fun way to experiment with this is to create some work in your cluster (a few external replications or subscriptions would do just fine) and then close one 
of the nodes.
You'll be able to see the cluster recognize the failed node and move work around to the surviving ones. A test you can run, which will give you a taste of RavenDB's failover
capabilities, is to have a client writing to the database and a subscription open when you close the node. (Make sure to close the node that the subscription
is assigned to.) You shouldn't notice anything happening from the outside. Both subscription and client will silently move to another node, and 
everything will _just work_. You can monitor all of the work in the database group from the `Ongoing Tasks` page as you run this experiment.

But you aren't the only one watching the state of the cluster. There's another entity in play here. That entity is the supervisor, and it's what's responsible
for making all those separate pieces cooperate seamlessly in the face of error conditions.

### The ever-watching supervisor

The cluster is continuously measuring the health of each node in the cluster, using a component known as the supervisor.^[I always imagine it in bright neon green
tights and a cape, flying around and spouting cliches as it keeps everything in order.] The supervisor will detect any errors in the cluster, react to a failed node
by reasssigning work and, in general, keep everything running.

This is important enough to mention here and not in the operations portion of the book because the supervisor also gives you a wealth of information about the 
state of the different nodes, as well as the database instances that are running on them. In addition to reassigning work to surviving nodes, it's also responsible for 
its most important roles: the promotion and demotion of database instances.

Given that RavenDB is a distributed database and not a military organization, what does that mean, "promotions and demotions"? Consider the case of a database 
group that has two database instances. We want to increase the number of replicas, so we add a new node to the database group. The process is fairly easy. All we 
need to do is to click `Manage group` in the studio and add the new node. 

On large databases, the process of adding a new replica can take a while. During that process, the newly added node isn't really part of the group. It can't
take over work in the group (we certainly don't want its backup until it's completely caught up, for example), and we don't want to failover clients to it 
(since it doesn't have the full data yet). Because of this, when you add a new node to a database group, it isn't added as a full-fledged member. Instead, it's
added as a promotable instance. 

But what does "promotable" mean? It means it can't be assigned work for the database group&mdash;that it can't be failed over to. In fact, it _is_ work for the
database group since one of the full members will have to start pushing data into this new node until it's fully up to date. This goes on until the 
supervisor can confirm that the new node is caught up with the state of the database group and that it's finished indexing all the data we sent to it. At 
this point, the supervisor will promote the node into a full member in the database group, work will be assigned to it and clients will consider it a 
failover target.

That works when we're talking about new nodes, but what happens when we have existing node fail? If a member node fails, we don't want to go back into the 
usual rotation as soon as it recovers. We want it to pull all the changes that happened in the meantime from the other members in the database group. Because
of that, the supervisor has the notion of sending a node to rehab.

A node in rehab isn't a full member of the cluster. It behaves exactly like a promotable node, for the most part.
Like a promotable node, one of the other members in the database group will connect to it and update the 
recovered node until it's fully up to date, at which point the supervisor will promote it to full member again.

The only important distinction between a rehab node and a promotable node is what happens when all the members in a database group are down. This is only 
relevant in pathological cascading failure scenarios.
Consider a cluster of three nodes with a database residing on nodes A and B. First, we have node B failing for some reason. (Perhaps the operations team took it
down to apply patches.) The supervisor will detect that and move node B to the rehab group. Node A will assume all duties that were previously assigned to 
node B. 

//TODO: image of a database graph

When node B comes back up, node A will send it all the updates that it missed. However, we're in somewhat of a pickle if node A is also failing at this point (the operations team now 
rebooting that node, without giving it time to get node B fully up to date). On the one hand, we don't have any working
members to failover to. On the other hand, node B is functioning, even though it's currently in rehab. 

At this point, when there are no more active members in the database group, the supervisor will rehabilitate an active node from the rehab group and mark
it as a full member in the database group, restoring functionality to that database.
This isn't ideal, of course, because it might be missing writes that happened to node A and haven't been replicated yet, but it's better than losing access
to the database completely.

The clients are also aware of the nodes in rehab, and if they're unable to talk to any of the members, they'll try to talk to the nodes in rehab as a last-ditch
effort before returning an error to the caller. A major reason we run this logic on both the clients and the supervisor is that this allows us to respond to 
errors in a distributed fashion in realtime. And this is without having to wait for the supervisor to find the failure and propagate the information about it throughout the cluster
and the clients.

Using demotions and promotions as needed, the supervisor is able to communicate to clients (and the rest of the cluster) which are the preferred nodes for a 
particular database group. Note that a failure doesn't have to be just a down node. Something as simple as running out of disk space can also cause a database
on a node to fail and be sent to rehab until that situation is fixed.

The supervisor is always running on the leader node, and it operates on the cluster level. In other words, it requires consensus to operate. This protects us
from a rogue supervisor deciding that all nodes are unresponsive and taking them down. But as long as it has the majority of the clusters' votes, the
supervisor is the authority on who's up or down in the cluster. Clients will avoid talking to nodes the supervisor can't talk to, even if they
can reach them.

### Ensuring a minimum number of replicas

When you create a database, you also specify the number of replicas for that database. This is used by the cluster to decide how many database instances it should create
for this database group. One of the roles of the supervisor is to make sure that this value is maintained over time. What do I mean by this?

Well, consider a five-node cluster and a database that was created with a replication factor of three. The cluster assigned this database to nodes A, B and E. After a while,
the supervisor notices that node E is down. It moves the node to the rehab program and hopes that it will recover. However, after a while (the default value is 15 minutes),
the supervisor decides that it can't assume that node E will come up any time soon and it needs to take action to ensure we have enough replicas for the data
in the database.

At this point, the supervisor will create another database instance on another node (C or D, in this case) and add it to the database group as promotable. At that
point, the database group will look like Figure 7.?.

//TODO: Figure of 5 nodes cluster and 2 db nodes up, 1 rehab, 1 promotable.

Two of the nodes in the database group are members in full health (A and B). We have node E in rehab, currently not responding, and we have the new node D that was added as
promotable. At this point, we have a race between node D and node E. Node D is getting all the data from the other members in the database group and becoming a full member. Meanwhile, node E is 
recovering and getting up to speed with all the changes it missed.

Either way, one of them will cross the finish line first, and we'll have three full replicas of the data in the database. At that point, the supervisor will
delete the extra copy that's now no longer needed. If node E is down for long enough, it will no longer be a part of the database group topology when it's back up,
and the cluster will tell it to delete the copy it currently holds. 
On the other hand, if node E recovers in time and catches up to the rest of the members before node D is ready, the supervisor will promote node E to the database group
members again. The supervisor will then let node D know it needs to delete the now-extraneous copy.

The logic behind the supervisor behavior is that a node is allowed to fail for a short amount of time (network partition, reboot for patching, etc.). But if it's gone for a 
long time, we need to assume it won't be coming back up, and we need to take action. It's important to take this behavior into account during maintenance. You need to let the 
supervisor know that it shouldn't take action and get in the way of the actual operator, which is handling things.

The supervisor's decisions can have a serious impact. For that reason, big decisions, such as moving a database
between nodes, will generate an alert for the operations team to review. Those alerts can be reviewed in the `Notifications Center`. That and other topics relating primarily to operations are covered in more depth in the
["Production Deployments"](#production-deployments) chapter.

### Summary

We started this chapter by talking about how we can grow our RavenDB cluster. We learned that, after a certain size, it doesn't make sense to add more members to a cluster. We
should add watchers instead. Those are non-voting nodes in the cluster that are still fully managed by it. The advantage is that we have a single cluster and only 
a single thing to manage, but we don't suffer from large majorities and the latencies they can incur.

From a single large cluster, we looked at what it would take to work with RavenDB with a geo-distributed environment. We looked at the implications of that and the pros 
and cons of having a single cluster span multiple geo-distributed data centers or having a separate cluster per data center. If we have separate clusters, we need to
share data between them, and external replication is the answer to that. External replication allows you to tie separate clusters together by replicating all changes to another 
database, not necessarily on the same cluster.

This is a good option for offsite replicas and to tie separate clusters together, but it also demarcates a clear line between the database instances that are in 
the same group and an external replication target. Database instances in the same group share work assignments between them, clients can failover from one instance
to another in the same group transparently, etc. With external replication, the only thing that happens is that data is flowing to the replication target isn't considered to be a part of the database group at all.

We looked into the kind of work you can assign to databases, such as backups and subscriptions or filling up promotables or in rehab nodes to allow them to catch up
to the rest of the nodes in the cluster. The supervisor is responsible for assigning the work, and it can reassign work if a node failed. 

The supervisor has a critical role in ensuring the proper functioning of a RavenDB cluster. In addition to monitoring the health of the cluster, it's also capable
of taking action if there are problems. A failed node will be moved to rehab until it's feeling better, and a node that's down for too long will be automatically
replaced by the supervisor. 

This was anything but a trivial chapter. I tried to focus on the high-level concepts more than the nitty-gritty details. The purpose of this chapter is to get you
to understand how RavenDB operates in a distributed environment. It _isn't_ about how to actually run it in such an environment. That's handled
in the ["Production Deployments"](#production-deployments) chapter. 

Beyond just setting up a cluster, you also need to know how to monitor and manage your systems. That's covered in a chapter dedicated just to that,
called ["Statistics, Monitoring and Insight"](#monitoring). We'll also talk a bit more about the implementation details that I intentionally skipped here. Your
operations team needs to understand what's going on, exactly. This chapter was about the overall concept.

In the next chapter, we'll talk about how we can integrate with other systems in your organization, and we'll introduce the concept of ETL^[Extract, transform, load], which allows
RavenDB to write data to external sources automatically.
