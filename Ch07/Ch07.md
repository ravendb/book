
# The query optimizer and dynamic queries

We started the previous chapter by talking about the following query, and how it _doesn't_ work. In this chapter, we'll spend our time talking about the entire process that make it possible to run such queries.

	var recentOrdersQuery =
		from order in session.Query<Order>()
		where order.Company == "companies/1"
		select order;

	var recentOrders = recentOrdersQuery.Take(3).ToList();

In RavenDB terms, the recent orders query is actually a dynamic query. We don't explicitly specify what index we want to use, and we just run the query as if we had no care in the world, and let RavenDB take care of all the details. But how is this actually done?

The RavenDB Client API translate the above query into the following REST call:
	
	GET /databases/Northwind/indexes/dynamic/Orders?&query=Company:companies/1&pageSize=3

If we break the call to its components parts, we'll have:

* /databases/Northwind - Using the Northwind database.
* /indexes/dynamic/Orders - Making a dynamic query on the Orders collection
* ?&query=Company:companies/1 - Where the Company property contains the "companies/1" value.
* &pageSize=3 - Get the first 3 results

A dynamic query like that is going to be sent to the query optimizer for processing.

## The Query Optimizer

The query optimizer is responsible for handling dynamic queries. The first part of its duties is to actually dispatch the query to the appropriate index. Listing 7.1 shows us how we can figure out what it actually did.

```{caption="{Using the query statistics to find the index used for the query}" .cs}
RavenQueryStatistics stats;
IRavenQueryable<Order> recentOrdersQuery =
	from order in session.Query<Order>()
		.Statistics(out stats)
	where order.Company == "companies/1"
	select order;

List<Order> recentOrders = recentOrdersQuery.Take(3).ToList();

Console.WriteLine("Index used was: " + stats.IndexName);
```

When we run the code in Listing 7.1, we will see that the indexed used was "Orders/Totals", one of the sample indexes in the Northwind database.
How did this happen? We certainly didn't specify that ourselves.

![The RavenDB query optimizer likes to chase down queries and send them to the right indexes.](.\Ch07\Fig01.png)

What happened was that the query optimizer got this query, and then it went over the indexes, looking for all the indexes that index the Orders collection and output the Company property to the index. When it found such an index, it threw a party and then executed the query on that index.

> **The query statistics**
> 
> The `RavenQueryStatistics` and the `.Statistics(stats)` call provide a wealth of information about the just executed query. Among the details you can get from the query statistics you have:
>
> * Whatever the index was stale or not.
> * The duration of the query on the server side.
> * The total number of results (regardless of paging).
> * The name of the index that this query run against.
> * The last document etag indexed by the index.
> * The timestamp of the last document indexed by the index.
> 
> In addition to that, you can use the `.ShowTiming()` to get additional detailed information about the execution time of the query on the server.

But what would happen if we executed a query that had no index covering it? For example, what would happen if we run the code in Listing 7.2?

```{caption="{No index exists to cover this query}" .cs}
RavenQueryStatistics stats;
IRavenQueryable<Order> recentOrdersQuery =
	from order in session.Query<Order>()
		.Statistics(out stats)
	where order.Company == "companies/1" 
		&& order.ShipTo.Country == "Italy"
	select order;

List<Order> recentOrders = recentOrdersQuery.Take(3).ToList();

Console.WriteLine("Index used was: " + stats.IndexName);
```

Note that the only change between Listing 7.1 and Listing 7.2 is that the addition of `&& order.ShipTo.Country == "Italy"` to the query. But because we have this additional property, we can't use any existing index. What will the query optimizer will do?

Well, executing this code tells us that the index used is named: "Auto/Orders/ByCompanyAndShipTo_Country". And if we look at the studio, it is defined as:

	from doc in docs.Orders
	select new
	{
		ShipTo_Country = doc.ShipTo.Country,
		Company = doc.Company
	}

What just happened? We didn't have this index just a minute ago!

What happened was that the query optimizer got involved. It got the query, which required us to have an index on Orders that indexed both the Company property and the ShipTo.Country property. But there was no such index in existence. At that point, the query optimizer got depressed, tried to drink away its troubles and considered vacation in Maui when that failed. Coming back from vacation, tanned and much happier, the query optimizer got down to business. We have a query that we have no index for, and RavenDB does not allow the easy and nasty solution of just iterating over all the documents in the database, also known as table scans, also known as 3 AM wakeup calls.

So the query optimizer decided to _create_ such an index. And hence, an index is born. The proud parent watched over the new index, ensuring that it does its job properly, and finally released it to the wild, to roam free and answer any queries that would be directed its way.

Leaving aside the anthropomorphism of the query optimizer, what is going on is that the query optimizer reads the query, and try to match a relevant index for it. If it can't find a relevant index, it will create the index that _can_ answer this query. It will then start executing the query against the index. Because indexing can take some time, it will wait until the query has enough results to fill a single page, or 15 seconds has passed (or it completed indexing, of course) before it will return the results to the user^[To do otherwise would _ensure_ that the very first dynamic query of a certain type would always result in no results being returned, which would be... confusing.].

### The life cycle of automatic indexes

Indexes that are created by the query optimizer are named with the `Auto/` prefix. This indicate that they were created by the query optimizer and that they are being _managed_ by the query optimizer as well.

An index in RavenDB is very efficient, but it isn't actually free. When we allow the query optimizer to just create an index on the fly, we also run the risk that so many indexes would be created that it would be a performance hog. In order to handle that, the query optimizer doesn't just create an index and set it free, it is actively managing it. 

A dynamic index (any index with the `Auto/` prefix, which only the query optimizer should generate) is being tracked for usage. If a dynamic index isn't being used, it will continuously downgraded and eventually removed. The actual process is a bit involved and contain some heuristics to avoid index churn (creating and deleting auto indexes).

An auto index is created, and from that point, it is things as usual as far as that index is concerned. It get filled in pretty much the same way as any other index. However, if the index isn't queried, we have to make a decision about what to do with this index. That depend on the index's age. If the index is older than an hour, it means that it had enough queries to hold it in the air for a long period of time, which in turn means that it is very likely that it will be used again.

In that case, the index goes down the reduce resource usage mode, which will first mark it as idle, and eventually abandoned. But if this is a new index, it means that we probably just tried some query out, or had a one off administrative query. In that case, we'll retire the index into an idle mode, and after that we'll delete it.

Over time, this result in a system that has only the indexes that it needs, and usually most of those indexes were created for us by the query optimizer. Another nice feature is that changes in behavior (for example, because of a new release) will result in the database optimizing itself for that behavior.

But the query optimizer still have some tricks to show us, let us talk about index merging.

### Index merging

A common question that is being asked in the mailing list is: "Is it better to have few fat indexes or more numerous lean indexes?"

The answer to that question is quite emphatically that we want the fewer and bigger indexes. A lot of the cost around indexing is around the actual indexing itself. The cost per indexed field is so minor it doesn't usually matter very much at all. That means that we have somewhat of a problem here, we create indexes on the fly, and most of the time they are created as indexes to answer a very particular query. Wouldn't that cause a lot of small indexes to be created?

Listing 7.3 shows several such queries run over products, each with a different set of fields it needs.

```{caption="{Running multiple dynamic queries on Products}" .cs}
RavenQueryStatistics stats;
var q = from product in session.Query<Product>()
			.Statistics(out stats)
	where product.Discontinued == false
	select product;

q.ToList();

Console.WriteLine(stats.IndexName);

q = from product in session.Query<Product>()
			.Statistics(out stats)
	where product.Category == "categories/1"
	select product;

q.ToList();

Console.WriteLine(stats.IndexName);

q = from product in session.Query<Product>()
			.Statistics(out stats)
	where product.Supplier == "suppliers/2" 
	&& product.Discontinued == false
	select product;

q.ToList();

Console.WriteLine(stats.IndexName);
```

The output of the code in Listing 7.3 is very interesting:

	Auto/Products/ByDiscontinued
	Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinued
	Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinuedAndSupplier

Just by the index names, you can probably guess what is going on. In order to reduce the number of indexes involved, when we create a new dynamic index, and other dynamic indexes for that collection also exists, we will merge them all.

> **What about the old dynamic indexes**
> 
> What does the query optimizer do with the Auto/Products/ByDiscontinued index once it creates the Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinued index? 
> And what does it does with the Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinued once it creates the Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinuedAndSupplier index?
> 
> The surprising answer is that it doesn't do anything. It doesn't need to. Those indexes are there, and would be cleaned out by the usual query optimizer process once they stop being used.
> Eventually, they will be removed, but there is no rush to do this right now, and that might actually hurt things.

 The end result of the code in Listing 7.3 would be a single fat index that can answer all our queries about the documents in a particular collection. That is the most optimal result in terms of indexing decisions. But that raise an interesting question, what would happen if we run the same code again, against the current database with the new automatic indexes?

 If you'll do that, you'll see that the only index being used is: Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinuedAndSupplier. 

### Dynamic index selection

When the query optimizer has more than a single choice for the index, in need to make a selection between those choices. And the choice it makes it usually based on a very simple metric. The width of the index. The wider the index, the more work it does, the easier it is to send it more queries, so we'll favor it.

Behind this decision there is the knowledge that automatic indexes that don't get enough queries will be removed, so just the fact that we aren't directly any queries to an index would end up removing it for us.

However, there is one scenario in which RavenDB will select an index to execute a query even if it isn't the widest index that can serve. Consider the following case, you have a document with a lot of documents, and an existing auto index (such as Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinued) and all of a sudden a new query comes by that require you to create a new index (such as Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinuedAndSupplier).

Queries that used to be served by Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinued can now be served by Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinuedAndSupplier, but there is a problem. Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinuedAndSupplier is a new index, and as such, didn't have the chance to go through all the data. If we direct queries to it that can be answered by Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinued, we might miss out on information that Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinued already have indexed.

Because of that, we also consider how up to date an index is, and we'll prefer the freshest index first, then the widest.

> **Querying the query optimizer**
> 
> You can ask the query optimizer what it was thinking, to give a particular index the chance to run a particular query. You can do that using the following REST call: 
> GET /databases/Northwind/indexes/dynamic/Products?query=Category:categories/2&explain=true
> 
> * /databases/Northwind - the database we use
> * /indexes/dynamic/Products - dynamic query on the Products collection
> * ?query=Category:categories/2 - querying all products in a particular category
> * &explain=true - explain what you were _thinking_.
>
> This can be helpful if you want to understand a particular decision, although most of the time, those are self-evident.

When the Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinuedAndSupplier index is up to date, we will start using only that index. And no queries will go to Auto/Products/ByCategoryAndDiscontinued. At that point, the self-cleaning features of the query optimizer will come into play, and because this index isn't in use any longer, it will be demoted to idle and then deleted or abandoned, depending on age.

The query optimizer does quite a bit of work, but we have only seen part of it. We looked at how it managed the indexes, but now let us look at the kind of 

## Complex dynamic queries

Our queries so far were pretty trivial. We queried on a root property of a document, and that was pretty much it. That is fine as it goes, but we are going to need more than that in real world applications. We are going to start looking into more complex queries, and how they are actually implemented as indexes on the server, then we'll talk about the actual querying options that we have available for us using dynamic queries.

### Querying collections

How about a query on all orders that has a specific product? Here is the code:

	var q = from order in session.Query<Order>()
		where order.Lines.Any(x => x.Product == "products/1")
		select order;

There are a few things going on here. We are able to query deep into the object structure, using the `Any` method. But note that we are actually pulling back the full document back. 
Listing 7.4 shows the index that was auto generated to answer such a query:

```{caption="{Auto generated index for searching for a purchased product on orders}" .cs}
from doc in docs.Orders
select new {
	Lines_Product = (
	  from docLinesItem in ((IEnumerable<dynamic>)doc.Lines)
	  	.DefaultIfEmpty()
	  select docLinesItem.Product).ToArray()
}
}
```

This index will project all the values in the Lines' Products into a single Lines_Product property, which is what we are actually querying. Note that this index will output a single index entry per document. That is generally a better idea, and how dynamic queries on collections work in RavenDB 3.0^[In 2.5, we'll have separate index entry for each line, which caused fan-out problems on large orders.].

However, extending this line of thinking forward, what happens when we want to create an even more complex query? A query for orders by a specific company for a specific product with a certain quantity, for example? The code for this query is in Listing 7.5.

```{caption="{Complex dynamic query and the resulting index}" .cs}
var q = from order in session.Query<Order>()
	where order.Company == "companies/1" &&
		order.Lines.Any(
			x => x.Product == "products/1" &&
				 x.Quantity == 4
			)
	select order;

// generated index
from doc in docs.Orders
select new {
	Lines_Quantity = (
	  from docLinesItem in ((IEnumerable<dynamic>)doc.Lines)
	  	.DefaultIfEmpty()
	  select docLinesItem.Quantity).ToArray(),
	Lines_Product = (
	   from docLinesItem in ((IEnumerable<dynamic>)doc.Lines)
	   	.DefaultIfEmpty()
	  select docLinesItem.Product).ToArray(),
	Company = doc.Company
}
```

This index, too, generates a single index entry. But note that the `Lines_Quantity` and `Lines_Product` are calculated separately. That means that this query can return the wrong result if we have an order for this specific company with the right product, but the right quantity is on another order line.

This issue happens because we collapse the index output into a single index entry, and thus we get a false positive. Handling this properly is a topic for the next chapter. For now, just be aware that using dynamic query, RavenDB will effectively rewrite a query such as the one in Listing 7.5 to a query line in Listing 7.6.

```{caption="{How RavenDB translates multiple collection clauses queries}" .cs}
from order in session.Query<Order>()
where order.Company == "companies/1" &&
	(
		order.Lines.Any(x => x.Product == "products/1") && 
		order.Lines.Any(x => x.Quantity == 4) 
	)
select order;
```

This was a choice made to avoid potentially devastating fan-outs (an index that generates multiple index entries per each document indexed, sometimes a _lot_ of index entries per document). Using a static index (covered in the next chapter) deals with this issue.

### Querying capabilities

Most of the time, when you query using RavenDB, you'll be using the LINQ API. We just encountered one limitation with querying into collections using that API, what can and cannot be done with RavenDB queries?

> **Dynamic queries are inherently limited**
>
> You can do quite a lot with dynamic queries, but in the end, they are limited to a very few operations. Comparing a value to a property on the object (or nested object or a collection object) is pretty much it. 
>
> For more complex queries, such as full text search, spatial queries or using computed results, we'll use static indexes.

We have already seen that we can compare to a value, so equality is obviously something that we can do. We can also query by range (greater or smaller than a value, or between two values). Listing 7.7 shows a few of the query options that we have:

```{caption="{Various querying options in RavenDB dynamic queries}" .cs}
// equality on document property
from order in session.Query<Order>()
where order.Company == "companies/1" 
select order;

// less than on document property
from order in session.Query<Order>()
where order.OrderedAt < new DateTime(2014,1,1) 
select order;

// greater than or equals on a nested collection object property
from order in session.Query<Order>()
where order.Lines.Any(l => l.Discount >= 5) 
select order;

// in on a document property
from order in session.Query<Order>()
where order.Employee.In("employees/1","employees/2","employees/3")
select order;

// starts with on a nested object property
from order in session.Query<Order>()
where order.ShipTo.Country.StartsWith("Is")
select order;

// complex conditionals
from order in session.Query<Order>()
where (
	order.OrderedAt < new DateTime(2014,1,1)  ||
	(
		order.ShipTo.Country.StartsWith("Is") &&
		order.Lines.Any(l => l.Discount >= 5) 
	)
)
select order;
```

As you can see in Listing 7.7, you can do quite a lot with dynamic queries. Most simple queries in RavenDB are using dynamic queries. But there is also a lot that you cannot do.

Consider the following query:

	from order in session.Query<Order>()
	from line in order.Lines
	where line.Discount >= 5
	select order;

Vs.

	from order in session.Query<Order>()
	where order.Lines.Any(l => l.Discount >= 5) 
	select order;

The first query and the second are conceptually the same, but the second one uses an `Any` method, instead of the multiple from clauses (or `SelectMany`, if you are using the method syntax). Conceptually the same, in the sense that this will result in the same filtering going on. But the output of those queries are very different.

In the first query, you'll get the order back as many times as you have lines in the order, while in the second query you'll get the order exactly once. That, and the exploding complexity of trying to parse arbitrary LINQ queries, has caused us to limit ourselves to the simpler syntax.

Group by clauses, let clauses, multiple from clauses, or join clauses in LINQ are also not supported for queries. They don't make a lot of sense for a document database, and while we have better alternative for those, the syntax exposed by LINQ doesn't make it possible to expose them easily. 

Ordering, however, is fully supported, as you can see in the following query:

	from order in session.Query<Order>()
	where order.Lines.Any(l => l.Discount >= 5) 
	orderby order.ShipTo.City descending
	select order;

It is important to remember that in RavenDB, querying is done on each document individually, it isn't possible to query a document based on another document's properties. Well, to be rather more exact, that is certainly possible, but that isn't done via dynamic queries. We'll touch on that as well in the next chapter.

### Includes in queries

What you can do with dynamic queries and associated documents is to `Include` them. We first run into includes in [Chapter 3](#include), but they are mostly useful during queries. Let us say that we want show the ten most recent orders, along with the company name that made that order, as showing in Listing 7.8.

```{caption="{Printing the top 10 recent orders and their company name, inefficiently}" .cs}
var q = from order in session.Query<Order>()
	orderby order.OrderedAt descending 
	select order;

foreach (var order in q.Take(10))
{
	var company = session.Load<Company>(order.Company);
	Console.WriteLine(company.Name +", " + order.OrderedAt +
		 ", " + order.ShipTo.Country);
}
```

The problem with the code in Listing 7.8 is that it generates a _lot_ of remote calls to the database, 11 of them, to be exact.
We can reduce all of that cost into a single remote call by utilizing includes, as seen in Listing 7.9.

```{caption="{Efficiently getting the latest orders and their company}" .cs}
var q = from order in session.Query<Order>()
			.Include(o=>o.Company)
	orderby order.OrderedAt descending 
	select order;
```

Now we only go to the database once, and the rest of the code remains just the same. You can also specify multiple include clauses, for example, if you wanted to load the company and the employee documents along with the query results.

This takes care of the 2rd Fallacy of Distributed Computing (latency is zero) by reducing the number of remote calls (and the price we have to pay for each of those). It doesn't takes care of handling the 3rd & 7th Fallacy (bandwidth is infinite & transport cost is zero). For those, we have projections and transformers.

### Projections

Consider the following query, what would be its output?

	from order in session.Query<Order>()
	where order.Employee = "employees/1"
	select order;

Well, it is pretty obvious that we are going to get the full order document back. And this is great, if we wanted the full document. But a lot of the time, we just want very few properties back from the query results, just enough to show them on a grid. How would that work? About as simply as you can think, see:

	from order in session.Query<Order>()
	where order.Employee = "employees/1"
	select new { order.Id, order.Company, order.OrderedAt };

Using this method, we can get just the relevant properties out, and not have to pay to shuffle full documents from the server to our client^[Remember the Fallacies of Distributed Computing! Or you'll regret that in the future.]. This reduction in size can save us a lot in terms of data transfer costs alone, even leaving aside the time factor.

This is great, except that we can only pull the data from the source document. We can't pull data from an associated document, so we still have to use `Include` for that, which give us the whole document. But we want just a property or two from there, nothing more.

In order to handle that, we can use transformers.

### Result Transformers

We already looked at Result Transformers in [Chapter 5](#result-transformers), in fact, we had to deal with this exact same problem there. Result transformers are server side LINQ statements that allow us to modify the output of the server.

Because they run server side, they have a lot of freedom to do things that we can't do from the client side. And one of those things is to pick just the right data to hand back to you. 

Let us look at 7.10, which shows a result transformer and its usage in a query^[When trying to use transformers, make sure to having `using Raven.Client.Linq;` at the top of the file, to expose the `TransformWith` extension method.]:

```{caption="Projecting data from multiple documents in a result transformer using queries" .cs }   
public class OrdersHeaders :
	AbstractTransformerCreationTask<Order>
{
	public class Result
	{
		public string Id { get; set; }
		public string CompanyName { get; set; }
		public DateTime OrderedAt { get; set; }
	}

	public JustOrderIdAndcompanyName()
	{
		TransformResults = orders =>
			from order in orders
			let company = LoadDocument<Company>(order.Company)
			select new 
			{ 
				order.Id, 
				CompanyName = company.Name, 
				order.OrderedAt 
			};
	}
}

var q = from order in session.Query<Order>()
	orderby order.OrderedAt descending 
	select order;

var orders = q.TransformWith<OrdersHeaders, OrdersHeaders.Result>()
	.Take(10);

foreach (var order in orders)
{
	Console.WriteLine("{0}\t{1}\t{2}", order.Id, order.CompanyName, order.OrderedAt);
}

```

Using this method, we are able to pick just the data that we want, and only send the relevant details to the client. 
There are a few important aspects to note here. The `TransformWith` method call takes a query, and operates over the _results_ of this query. Note that even actions that appear to happen later (like the `Take(10)` call) will be applied _before_ the transformer is run.

In other words, on the server side, we'll only get 10 orders to work through inside the transformer. That means that we'll only need to run the transformation (and load the associated company) 10 times. 

Another result of this decision is that by the time the transformer is called, all the paging and the sorting has already been done for it, so while it can apply its own filtering and sorting, the data it will received has been processed.

It is very common to use transformers for getting the data to show whenever you have a grid or a table of some sort. You can pick just the data you want (or even do this dynamically), and you can even merge data from multiple documents, if that makes sense. 

All of that assumes that you have relatively large documents, and that you only want to show a few of their properties, if you actually need the whole thing. If that doesn't hold true, just load the entire document.

## DocumentQuery vs. LINQ queries

The language integrated query is one of my favorite features in .NET. I distinctly remember watching the PDC session in 2005 and feeling insulted. .NET 2.0 wasn't officially out yet, but it already felt clunky compared to the LINQ statements shown in the PDC.

Then .NET 3.5 came out, and we actually got to see the kind of work that was involved in writing LINQ. From the customer, it was pure joy, most of the time. From the _provider's_ point of view, however, things were much different. 

I had the chance to take part in several different LINQ providers, including NHibernate's attempt to provide full & complete support for everything you can do in LINQ. That was _hard_. 

With RavenDB, we had to deal with the fact that even though LINQ isn't database dependent, a lot of the operations had a distinctly relational smell to them. The `join` clause pops to mind, of course. But RavenDB has a pretty good LINQ support, even if that cost us in a lot of effort.

But as great LINQ is, its greatest asset is also its weakness. It is compiled time checked, which is great if you want to ensure that your code isn't going to query `Customer`^[Note the spelling issue.] and then spend a lot of time not figuring out what is wrong.

It isn't so great when you want to generate dynamic queries. In relational databases, this is the time you start breaking the string concatenation tools from the torture chamber, or the Query Object from the Pattern basement. In RavenDB, you switch to using the `DocumentQuery` API^[This API was previously called Lucene Query API.]. 

> **Layered APIs**
> 
> The LINQ provider is actually built on top of the `DocumentQuery` API, so anything that the LINQ query can do, so can the `DocumentQuery` API. This pattern, of layering APIs on top of one another, with each layer providing additional services is very common in RavenDB.

> We already run into that with the Session API on top of the `DatabaseCommands` API on top of REST calls. 

Accessing the `DocumentQuery` API is done like this:

	var orders = session.Advanced.DocumentQuery<Order>()
		.WhereEquals(x => x.Company, "companies/1")
		.AndAlso()
		.WhereIn("Employee", new[] {"employees/1", "employees/2"})
		.ToList();

As you can see, even in the `DocumentQuery` API, you still have the ability to use type safe methods, or to just use strings. Note that the query object is being mutated by the calls, and finally triggered via the `.ToList()` call.

You can also call `.ToString()` on the query, to see what will be sent to the server. In the case of the query above, we'll have the following query:

	Company:companies/1 AND @in<Employee>:(employees/1,employees/2)

This is using RavenDB's modified Lucene syntax, In general, the `DocumentQuery` API provides the following query options, which translate to a Lucene fragment. You can see the behavior in Listing 7.11.

```{caption="DocumentQuery options and their query syntax" .cs }   
q.WhereLessThan<DateTime>(o => o.OrderedAt, DateTime.Today);
        OrderedAt:{* TO 2014-09-07T00:00:00.0000000}

q.WhereLessThanOrEqual<DateTime>(o => o.OrderedAt, DateTime.Today);
        OrderedAt:[* TO 2014-09-07T00:00:00.0000000]

q.WhereGreaterThan<decimal>(o => o.Freight, 5M);
        Freight_Range:{Dx5 TO NULL}

q.WhereGreaterThanOrEqual<decimal>(o => o.Freight, 5M);
        Freight_Range:[Dx5 TO NULL]

q.WhereBetween<decimal>(o => o.Freight, 5M, 10M);
        Freight_Range:{Dx5 TO Dx10}

q.WhereBetweenOrEqual<decimal>(o => o.Freight, 5M, 10M);
        Freight_Range:[Dx5 TO Dx10]

q.WhereStartsWith<string>(o => o.ShipVia, "UP");
        ShipVia:UP*

q.WhereIn<string>(o => o.Employee, 
	new string[]{"employees/1", "employees/2"});
        @in<Employee>:(employees/1,employees/2)
```

You can find the full reference for how the DocumentQuery work in the online documentation. But note that it is _very strongly_ recommended that you'll not try to generate the query strings yourself. Using the API is much simpler, and it takes care of quite a lot of things behind the scene for you. For example, in Listing 7.11, you can see the comparisons to Freight. That is a decimal field, and we handle sending comparison by using the _Range field^[We'll deal with those in a later chapter] and by specifying the value as Dx5, which indicate that this should be treted as a decimal value. 

Beyond the query options, the `DocumentQuery` API also contain many query options. You can ask the query to provide detailed timing information using `ShowTiming`, or to explain why the ranking of the documents using `ExplainScores`. You can gain fine grained control of the query using `OpenSubClause` and `CloseSubClause` or `AndAlso` and `OrElse`, or specifying ordering using `AddOrder`.

But the most interesting options features are used in static indexes, spatial queries, highlights and facets are all available through the `DocumentQuery`. But those are covered in the next chapters.

### Property Paths

In dynamic queries, the property path that we use tell RavenDB how to find the data we need to look at. The simple property paths looks like the following snippet:

	Company: companies/1
	Employee: employees/1

Those refer directly to properties on the document. But more complex paths are possible when we want to refer to nested objects, as shown below:

	ShipTo.City: London
	ShipTo.Country: Israel

As expected, access a nested property is done using the familiar dot notation. But what happens when we want to query inside a collection? Because that require a very different handling, very early on, we use a different syntax to handle this, the comma notation:

	Lines,Price: 15
	Lines,Product: products/84

The comma operator is used to indicate that we are actually going into a collection. Of course, you can mix those up. If the order line contained an `Address` object of its own, we could do:

	Lines,ShipTo.City: London

Which tells RavenDB that first need to go to the Lines collection, fetch the nested property City from the ShipTo object, then compare that to the value.

What actually happen is that the query optimizer is going to run through this syntax, generate the appropriate index if needed, transform the query and then run that query against the index.

Note that this syntax applies _only_ for dynamic indexes. It doesn't affect querying of static indexes.

## Summary

In this chapter, we started by taking the role of the query optimizer and seeing all the things that it is doing. From managing queries to generating indexes on the fly to _removing_ indexes on the fly and in general taking care of our indexes in general.

The query optimizer takes care to do this in a way to result in an optimal system, but merging common indexes and remove old and unused ones. After going over the query optimizer details, we go down to business and looked at how dynamic queries actually worked.

We queried simple properties, and then values stored inside collections, then we looked at the type of queries that can be made using dynamic queries. And that cover quite a lot of ground. We can do equality and range comparisons, compare a value to a list to find if it is in that or create complex queries by combining multiple clauses. 

Following queries, we moved to what we can do with the data they give us, and we looked into using `Include` in queries. This is where they really shine, since you can drastically reduce the number of remote calls that you have to make.
Even that wasn't enough for us, so we looked into reduce the amount of data we send over the wire by using projections, and when that isn't enough, we have transformers in our toolbox as well.

Using transformers we can pull data from multiple documents, if needed, and get just the data that we need. This give us a way to fine tune exactly what we need, reducing both the number of remote calls and the size on the wire.

Finally, we looked at how queries are actually implemented. We inspected `DocumentQuery` and saw that we can use it for fully dynamic queries, without requiring any sort of predefined type, and that this is what the RavenDB LINQ API is actually using under the covers. We looked at the result of such queries, using the Lucene syntax and then explored how the query optimizer is using specific property path syntax to know how to get to the data.

Coming next, we'll start learning about static indexes in RavenDB, which is quite exciting, since this is where a lot of the really cool stuff is happening.
