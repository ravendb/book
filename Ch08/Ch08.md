## Sharing data and making friends with ETL

[Sharing data and making friends with ETL]:(#integrations)

While talking about distributed work with RavenDB so far we have focused primarily on the work that RavenDB is doing to replicate data between different nodes
in the same cluster as part of the same database group or between different database in potentially different clusters. This mode of operation is simple, 
because you don't just setup the replication and RavenDB will take care of everything else. But there are other modes for distributing data in your systems.

Replication assumes that you have another RavenDB instance and that you want to replicate _everything_ to it. When replicating information, that is what you
want, but we also have a need to share a _part_ of the data. ETL^[Extract, Transform, Load] is the process in which we take data that resides in RavenDB
and push it to an exteranal source, potentionally transforming it along the way. That exteranal source can be another RavenDB instance or a relational database. 

Consider a micro service architecture and the Customer Benefits service. This service decides what kind of benefits the customer has. This can be anything
from free shipping to giving a discount on every 3rd jug of milk and the logic can be as simple as "this customer is in our membership club" to complex as 
trying to compute airline miles. Regardless of how the Customers Benefits service works, it need to let other parts of the system know about the 
benefits that this customer has. The Shipping service, the Helpdesk service and many others need to have that information. 

At the same time, we _really_ don't want them to poke their hands into the Customers Benefits database (or worse, have a shared database for everything)^[Doing
so is a great way to ensure that you'll have all the costs of a micro service architecture with none of the benefits.]. We could design an API between the 
systems, but then the Shipping service will be dependent on the Customer Benefits service to always be up. A better solution is to define an ETL process between
the two services and have the Customer Benefits service publish updates for the Shipping service to consume. Those updates are part of the publiccontract of
those services, mind. You shouldn't just copy the data between the databases.

Another example is the reporting database, RavenDB is a wonderful database for OTLP scenarios, but for reporting, your organization likely already have a 
solution, and there is really little need to replace that. But you can't just dump the data from RavenDB directly into a relational database and expect things
to work. We need to transform the data as we send it to match the relational model.

For all of those needs, RavenDB has the notion of ETL processes. RavenDB has builtin ETL to another RavenDB instance and to a relational database 
(such as MS SQL Server, Postgres, Oracle, MySQL, etc). 
Because RavenDB has native relational ETL, brown field systems will typically start using RavenDB by replacing a single component at a time, RavenDB is used
to speed up the behavior of high value targets, but instead of replacing the whole system, we use ETL processes to write the data to the existing relational
database. We'll cover that later in this chapter, discussing the deployment of RavenDB as a write-behind cache.

In most cases, the rest of the system doesn't even need to know that some parts are using RavenDB. This is using RavenDB as the write behind cache.
Some part of your application reads and writes to RavenDB directly, and RavenDB will make sure to update the relational system. 
We'll start talking about ETL processes between RavenDB instances, because we explore the whole ETL process without introducing another database instance.


### ETL processes to another RavenDB instance

Any non trivial system is going to have at least a few ETL processes and RavenDB has a good story on how to handle that. The simplest ETL process between
two RavenDB nodes is telling RavenDB that we want to send just a single collection to the other side. We first need to configure the connection string
we'll use. Because RavenDB ETL work between clusters, we may need to define multiple URLs, and it is easier to put it all in a single location. 

Go to `Settings` and then to `Connection Strings` and create a new RavenDB connection string. The easiest is to use create a new database in your cluster
and setup the connection string to it. As you can see in Listing 8.1, I've defined a connection string to the `helpdesk` database in the live test instance.

![Defining a connection string to another RavenDB instance.](./Ch08/img01.png)

With the connection string defined, we can now go ahead and build the actual ETL process to the remote instance. Go to `Settings` and then to 
`Manage Ongoing Tasks` and click the `Add Task` button and then select `RavenDB ETL`. You can see how this looks like in Figure 8.2.
Give it a name and select the previously defined connection string.

Now we need to let RavenDB know what will be ETL'ed to the other side. We do that by defining scripts that control the ETL proceess. Click on the 
`Add New Script` and give it a name such as "Employees to Helpdesk" and then select the Employees collection below, click on `Add Collection` and
then on `Save`. The result should look like Figure 8.3.

![Defining a simple "copy the whole collection" ETL script](./Ch08/img03.png)

Because we didn't specify anything in the ETL script, RavenDB will just copy the entire collection as is to the other side. This is useful on its own
because it allow us to share a single (or a few) collections with other parties with very little work.

It is _very_ important to remember that ETL is very different from replication. When a RavenDB node perform ETL to another, it is not replicating the data, it 
is _writing_ it. In other words, there are no conflicts and no attempt to handle such. Instead, we'll always _overwrite_ whatever exists on the other side. 
As far as the destination node is concerned, the ETL process is just another client writing data to the database. This is done because the data is _not_
the same. This is important because of a concept that we didn't touch so far, data ownership.

So far we have only done ETL at the collection level, but we can also modify the data as it is going out. Let's see how we can do that, and why would we want
to do this. 

#### ETL Scripts

Sometimes you don't want to send a full document in the ETL process. Sometimes you want to filter them or modify their shape. This is quite important  
since ETL processes compose a part of your public interface. Instead of just sending your documents to remote destination willy nilly, you'll typically only
send data that you are interested in sharing, and in a well defined format.

Consider the employees we sent over the wire, we sent them as is, potentially exposing our own internal document structure and making it harder to modify in 
the future. Let us create a new ETL process which will send just the relevant details and add a script for sending redacted employee information over the wire. 
You can see how this looks like in Figure 8.4.

![Using ETL with a script to redact the results](./Ch08/img04.png)

It is important to understand that when we are using an ETL script to modify what is sent, we need to take into account that RavenDB will send just what we told
it to. This seems obvious, but it can catch people unaware. If you don't have a script, the data sent to the other side will include attachments and will go to 
the same collection as the source data.

However, when you provide your own script, you need to take responsability for this yourselves. Listing 8.1 shows an example of a slightly more complex example.

```{caption="Creating a subscription to process customers" .js}
var managerName = null;
if(this.ReportsTo !== null)
{
    var manager = load(this.ReportsTo);
    managerName = manager.FirstName + " " + manager.LastName;
}
    
loadToEmployees({
    Name: this.FirstName + " " + this.LastName,
    Title: this.Title,
    BornOn: new Date(this.Birthday).getFullYear(),
    Manager: managerName
});
```

The script in Listing 8.1 will send the employees, their title, birth year and manager over to the other side. You can see that the script is 
actually full blown javascript and allow you complete freedom with how you extract the data to load into the remote server. A word a caution
is required about using functions such as `load` in this context, though. While this will work just fine, the referencing document will not be 
updated if the referenced document has been updated. In other words, if the manager's name has been udpated, it will not trigger an update 
to the employees that report to this manager.

It is common to limit yourself to just the data from that particular document, since that make it easy to ensure that whenever the document is
changed, the ETL process will reflect these changes completely on the other side. 

> **Reseting the ETL process after update** 
>
> It is common to test out the ETL process as you develop it, but by default, updates to the ETL script will not applied to documents that
> were already sent. You can use the "Apply script to documents from beginning of time" option during the script update, as shown in 
> Figure 8.5 to let RavenDB know that it needs to start the ETL process for this script from scratch, rather than apply the update only 
> to new or updated documents.
> 
> ![Reseting the ETL process after a script update](./Ch08/img05.png)
>
> This is done to avoid expensive reset that would force RavenDB to send all the data all over again for a minor change.

Looking on the other side, you'll be able to see the replicated document, as shown in Listing 8.2.

```{caption="ETL'ed document on the side" .json}
{
	"BornOn": 1966,
	"Manager": "Steven Buchanan",
	"Name": "Anne Dodsworth",
	"Title": "Sales Representative",
	"@metadata": {
		"@collection": "Employees",
		"@change-vector": "A:84-4Xmt8lVCrkiCDii/CfyaWQ",
		"@id": "employees/9-A",
		"@last-modified": "2017-12-04T12:02:53.8561852Z"
	}
}
```

There are a few interesting things in the document in Figure 8.2. First, we can see that it has only a single change vector entry (for the destination
database) and the last modified date is when it was written to the destination, not when it updated on the source. 

#### Multiple documents from a single document

Another interesting ETL example is when we want to push multiple values out of a single document, as showing in Listing 8.3.

```{caption="Sending multiple documents from a single source document in ETL" .js}
loadToEmployees({
    Name: this.FirstName + " " + this.LastName,
    Title: this.Title,
    BornOn: new Date(this.Birthday).getFullYear(),
});

loadToAddresses({
    City: this.Address.City,
    Country: this.Address.Country,
    Address: this.Address.Line1
});
```

The results of the script in Listing 8.3 can be seen in Figure 8.6. You can see that the `Employees` documents were sent, but are also the addresses documents. 
For those, we use the prefix of the source document to be able to identify them after the fact. 

![Multiple outputs from a single source document on the destiantion](./Ch08/img06.png)

An important consideration for sending multiple documents from a single source document is that on every update to the source document _all_ the documents that 
were created from this document are refreshed. You don't have control over the ids being generated and shouldn't assume that they are fixed.
