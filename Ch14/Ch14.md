## Encrypting your data

There are three states of data. Data in transit, when it flows through the network. Data in use, when it is actively being
read and modified and data at rest, which refers to data that is stored in stable storage. In the previous chapter, we discussed
securing your data in transit using TLS 1.2 and strong encryption. In this chapter, we are going to focus on securing your data
at rest. 

Some data is intrinsically public in nature, a press release, for example. Some data is _very_ private, such as healthcare, 
financial, personally identifying, etc. A part of any security consideration is the notion of a defence in depth. Even if your
servers are protected (physically and virtually), you still need to consider the case that someone will be able to get their
hands on your data.

RavenDB supports strong encryption (`XChaCha20Poly1305` with 256 bits key) to do full and transparent data encryption of your
entire database. This feature ensures that nothing unencrypted is written to the disk and even in memory, outside of a running
transaction, everything is encrypted. 

In many industries, data encryption is a regulatory requirement (PCI and HIPPA comes to mind) and it is a fairly routine 
request even if the application in question doesn't _require_ it, but can benefit from the additional safeties it provies. 
The encryption of data at rest doesn't come to replace other security measures (such as limit access to your database, encrypting
the communication lines, protecting your access credentials, etc) but to complement them. 

The major advantage of having encryption at the database level is that you don't need to change anything in your applications 
and clients. RavenDB will take care of all encryption behind the scenes, with no external changes that you have to deal with. 
A user that has access to an encrypted database can simple access it, query documents, modify them, etc. RavenDB will take 
care of encrypting and decrypting data as needed. RavenDB also require all encrytped database access to use HTTPS, so this takes
care of the data in transit portion as well.

RavenDB goes to great lengths to ensure that on disk, and even in memory, your data is encrypted. The data is only decrypted when
there is an active transaction, and even then, only the pieces that are touched by that transaction are decrypted. Once the 
transaction is completed, RavenDB will zero the memory to erase the sensitive data. 

Database encryption should be deployed as part of comprehensive security strategy, including control access to the machines, 
having a secure backup strategy, including security concerns with your high availability and offsite deployment, key management
and the appropriate audit / monitoring tools. This is a much wider topic than can be covered in this book, so I'll focus only
on the details of data encryption in RavenDB.

Before we get to the details, I want to mention that encryption has a cost. In terms of the database performance, it is usually
around 15% - 20%, depending on the exact load. In most cases, that is a perfectly fine price to pay for the additional security.
However, there are also additional cost in managing encrypted databases. Key management and backup, secure backups, being able 
to _get_ the encryption key when you need to restore the database, etc. 

All of these can add up to significant operational overhead, as much as RavenDB attempts to reduce it. I suggest ensuring  that
you need the benefits of database encryption before enabling this feature, rather than just saying "encryption is good" and 
pressing forward needlessly. 

We'll start by doing a walkthough of actually defining an encrypted database through the studio, to get you started, and then
we'll dive into what is actually going on behind the scenes and how RavenDB is actively protecting your data.

### Setting up an encrypted database

The first requirement for an encrypted database is that your cluster will run in a secured mode. There is no point is securing
the data on disk if anyone on the network can see the data going in and out. In the [previous chapter](#security) we went over 
the steps required for a such a setup, so I'll skip them here. 

A database in RavenDB can be marked as encrypted at creation time. You can see how this looks like on the studio in Figure 14.1.

![Creating an encrypted database](./Ch14/img01.png)

An encrypted database uses a 256 bits key to encrypt all the data stored in the database. Without that key, the data in the 
database is only so much random seeming noise. As you can imagine, that key is _important_. RavenDB also provides no way to 
get the encryption key of an existing database, you have to know that in advance. The properties of the key are also important.
The key is a 256 bits value, generated using a cryptographically strong random number generator. You _can_ provide you own key,
but in general, there is little reason to bother. 

What you should be doing is keep a copy of the encryption key somewhere, so you'll have access to this key (and thus, the 
database using it) later on, if needed. RavenDB make such a decision explicit, as you can see in Figure 14.2. 

![Encryption configuration includes just the key, and require that you'll store a copy of it](./Ch14/img02.png)

You have to confirm that you have made sure that you have a copy of the key. For convience's sake, RavenDB offers the ability
to print the key (as well as it's QR code). The idea here is that you print this page, and then file it away in a locked 
cupboard somewhere. Even the most sophisticated of computer attakcs will have a hard time reaching to information stored on
paper, and that is a method that can easily be implemented. 

Of course, in many organizations there is already some policy around encryption keys usage, storage and backup. Sometimes it 
is with Hardware Security Modules, sometimes using services such as vault such as the Azure Vault, Keywhiz and HashiCorp Vault.
Regardless, you should have a copy of the encryption key.

> to another machine (which must be provided with the key) and if you want to add a new node to the encrypted database
> group and want all the nodes to use the same key (which is desired, but not required).

Another requirement for encrypted databases is that the admin _has_ to select what nodes should be part of the encrypted database
group. Usually RavenDB will select these based on its own cognizance, but for encrypted databases, an admin needs to specify that
directly. This is to handle such cases where you have severs that might have different security zones in the same cluster.

> 
> For this reason, you need to select the nodes that will particpate manually and they must be up and available during the 
> database creation time so they can accept the new key.

Once the database is created, this is pretty much it, as far as deviations from the standard usage and configuration of databases
is concerned. 

### Full database encryption

Caesar, about 21 centuries ago, used a cipher to send messages securely, by shifting the letters of his messages by 3 characters.
When most of the population was illiterate, that was probably sufficent security. Today, the science of cryptography and 
cryptoanalysis is a _bit_ more complex.

The goal of encryption is to take an input and a key, and then generate a random looking pattern of bytes, with no
way to go back to the original input with having the key. That is only part of what a good encryption scheme must deal with 
today, though. Moderm cryptography needs to handle such things as timing (and other side channels) attack, forward secrecy,
authenticated encryption and many other details that are curcial for the security of the system but tend to be rather 
obtuse, onerous and obscure to those who aren't well versed in the world of encryption.

RavenDB uses the Daniel J. Bernstein’s `XChaCha20Poly1305` algorithm to encrypt your databases, as implemented by the libsodium 
library. Both the algorithm and the library have been analyzed and audited by cryptographic experts and passed with flying 
colors. I'm not going to discuss the actual encryption, that is quite out of scope for this book and you can find the gory 
details elsewhere. I'm going to focus on the way RavenDB uses encryption to protect your data. You can safely skip this 
section, as it has very little impact on using and operating RavenDB.

Internally, RavenDB holds your data inside a datafile (usually called `Raven.voron`) that is memory mapped to the RavenDB 
process. We also use temporary files^[This files are also memory mapped, but they aren't presistent, as far as RavenDB is 
concerned. Instead, we are using memory mapped files to avoid using too much private memory and give the operatin system
well known backing store for this temporary memory. It also allows RavenDB to have fine grained control over the memory
usage required by the storage requirements.] which typically found in in the `Temp` directory and having names such as:
`Temp/scratch.0000000000.buffers` or `Temp/compression.0000000000.buffers`) during the day-to-day operations of RavenDB. 
There are also the write ahead journals, which are the key to RavenDB's transactional nature and ACID capabilities, these
are stored in the `Journals` directory with names such as `Journals/0000000000000000001.journal` or 
`Journals/0000000000000000002.journal`. 

All these files contain some portion of your document data, and as such, need to be encrypted. Let's see how we deal with
encrypting each of them in turn. 

#### Encrypting the write ahead journal

The write ahead journal is a set of files (`Journals/0000000000000000001.journal`, `Journals/0000000000000000002.journal`, etc)
that RavenDB uses to maintain its ACID guarnatees. Each journal file is allocated in advanced (typically 256MB at a time) and 
a new transaction is written to the file whenever it is committed. Indeed, a transaction cannot be considered committed unless
it has been successfully written to the journal file^[RavenDB uses direct and unbuffered I/O to write to the disk, ensuring 
that writes are actually persistent, skipping the caches in the middle.].

A journal file is a set of consecutive transactions. When RavenDB opens a database, it will read the journal file, find all the
transactions that hasn't been synced to disk yet and apply them to the data file. In this way, even if we crashed, we can be 
certain that no data has been lost. Without encryption, a transaction is protected using a non cryptographic hash (`XXHash64`)
to ensure that the full transaction has been written to disk. This allow us to verify whatever a transaction was committed or
not.

With encryption, we store only the transaction header unencrypted in the journal file. The transaction data itself is encrypted
using `XChaCha20Poly1305`. This is an authenticated encryption algorithm, giving us cryptographic assurance that if the 
decryption was successful, the data we got matches the data we encrypted. Since we are already verifying the integrity of the
data, we don't bother also using `XXHash64` on the transaction when using encryption.
Each transaction is encrypted with a different key, derived from the master key and the transaction id and a 192 bits random
nonce. 

#### Encrypting the main data file

The main data file (`Raven.voron`) contains all the data in your database. Unlike the journals, which are written to in a
consecutive manner, one transaction at a time, the data file is written and read from using random I/O. In order to handle this
mode of operations, the data file is split into 8KB pages^[There are a lot of other reasons why the data is divided into pages,
and this is how RavenDB works without encryption as well. It just happens that it also plays very nicely into the requirements
for using the data while keeping it encrypted.] which can be treated as independent of one another. 
If there is a value that is over 8KB in size, it will use as many consecutive pages as needed, and will be treated as a single
page. 

Each page is encrypted independently. This means that when we need to read a page, we can go directly to that page, decrypt it
and read its content without having to touch anything else in the database. In this fashion, we gain the ability to do random
reads and writes through the database. The structure of a page is shown in Figure 14.4.

![The internal structure of an encrypted page in RavenDB](./Ch14/img04.png)

As you can see in Figure 14.4, the page is composed of a header, nonce, MAC and the data itself. You are already familiar with
the nonce. But what is the MAC field for? This is the Message Authentication Code, which is used to verify that the page hasn't
been modified (see the section about Authentication Encryption previously in this chapter). Another interesting tidbit is the
fact that the space we have for the nonce is only 16 bytes (128 bits), but we know that the `XChaCha20Poly1305` algorithm uses
a 192 bits (24 bytes) nonce. Listing 14.1 shows what is actually is going on

```{caption="Internal structure of the page header and the full nonce usage"}
+--------+
|Page    |
|Header  |
|        |
|32 bytes| <-------+
+--------+         |
|Nonce   |      Actual nonce
|16 bytes|         |24 bytes
+--------+ <-------+
|MAC     |
|16 bytes|
+--------+
```

When RavenDB needs to encrypt a page, it will generate a 128 bits random value and store it in the nonce portion of the page 
header. However, when we need to pass a nonce to `XChaCha20Poly1305`, we will pass a value that is 24 bytes in size, starting
8 bytes _before_ the nonce. In other words, the nonce also contain 8 bytes from the page header.
In practice, this means that the nonce is using 128 bits of randomness with an additional 64 bits that will change as RavenDB
sees fit. 

Each page is encrypted using a dedicated key, derived from the master key and the page number of this page. The page header is
stored unencrypted, naturally, and the page's contents are encrypted.

#### How RavenDB access encrypted data?

RavenDB keep all the data in an encrypted database encrypted at all times, both on disk and in memory. Whenever a transction
needs to access a particular page, that page is decrypted into memory that is owned by that transaction. For the duration of
the transaction, the unencrypted values touched by this transaction will be resident in memory. 
When the transaction is over, that memory will be securely wiped. 

To futher protect your data, RavenDB will attempt to lock the unencrypted data in memory, so it will not be written to a 
page file and will not be visibile in core dumps. This is done by calling `mlock` or `VirtualLock`, depending on the system
in question.

Locking memory into physical RAM is subject to certain limitations, and may require you to change system configuration to 
allow RavenDB to lock enough memory to handle routine operations. If your threat model doesn't include worrying about attackers
digging into the page file, you can tell RavenDB that it is fine to fail to lock memory using the following configuration 
option: `Security.DoNotConsiderMemoryLockFailureAsCatastrophicError`. 

This might be a valid choice if the system doesn't _have_ a swap or a page file defined or if you are using encrypted swap 
already, so there is no need to worry about data leaks from there. 

RavenDB also uses a few temporary files (`Temp/scratch.0000000000.buffers` and `Temp/compression.0000000000.buffers`, for
example). In terms of encryption, there are two types that we care about. First, you have the `scratch` files, which is where
RavenDB writes your data until it is writen to the data file. These files are encrypted in the exact same manner as the data
file. Whenver there is the need to access data from one of them, they are decrypted to a temporary storage for the transaction
and then wiped after the transaction has been completed.

> log documents' data to the log file, even on the highest logs detail, but it can certain write document IDs in certain cases.
> In such a case, you should either ensure that the logs directory is an encrypted directory or disable logging entirely. 

The other set of files are used as temporary buffers and are wiped immediately after use. The `compression` set of files, for
example, are used as part of writing to the journal. We write the transaction data to the memory mapped `compression` file and
then compress it, then we encrypt the data and finally write the encrypted compressed data to disk. Once that is done, we'll 
securely wipe the `compression` file memory to remove all traces of your data from memory.

What is encrypted when you use encrypted file? Everything that is stored within the database file, which includes:

* Documents
* Revisions
* Conflicts
* Attachments
* Tombstones

What is _not_ encrypted are values that are stored at the level of the cluster, which are:

* Identities
* Compare Exchange Values
* The database record

The identity is generally not considered to be sensitive information, but Compare Exchange value most certainly can contain
data that you'll wish to keep private. Most importantly, the database record may contain connection strings to other databases.
This is relevant only if you are using SQL ETL and providing the connection string password in the connection string.
In this case, the full connection string is stored at the cluster level, and is not impacted by the encryption mode of the 
database in question.

To enable encryption at the cluster level, you'll need to take additional steps, as we'll see now.

#### Encrypting the cluster information

In addition to storing your databases' data, RavenDB also stores data at the cluster level. This is usually called the server 
store and it is managed independently by any node in the cluster. The data that is stored there includes all the database 
records, identities, compare exchange values, etc. 
This is stored in all the nodes in the clusters, including databases that do not reside on this particular node.

You can also encrypt the information on the server store, although it is a bit more involved than the process of encrypting
a database, and you must repeat this operation on _all_ the nodes in the cluster.

1. Shutdown the RavenDB node
2. Run `rvn offline-operation encrypt /path/to/system-db`
3. Restart the RavenDB node

The key here is in the second step. This loads the existing server store (which typically resides in the `System` 
directory), generate a new key (see the section about Key Management a bit later in this chapter) and encrypt the server store
using this key.

This should be done on all the nodes in the nodes in the cluster, and will typically result in a different key being generated
for each of the nodes. Note that RavenDB does _not_ enforce system store encryption on all the nodes. This is done to allow
rolling migration of encrypting of the system store (taking a node at a time, encrypting it and restarting it). If you decdied
to encrypt your system store, make sure that this is done on all the nodes in the cluster. This includes _adding new nodes_, 
you can also run the `rvn offline-operation encrypt` command prior to adding the new node to the cluster, so at no point will
it write unencrypted information to disk.

#### Encrypting indexes

In addition to the main data file, there are also indexes to consider. Each index actually have a separate `Raven.voron` file,
it's own `scratch` and `compression` files, etc. And just like the main data file, this is encrypted on all levels, using the
exact same techniques that we just discussed.

During queries, the indexing transaction will decrypt the relevant pages so you can perform searches normally, then wipe the
data from the memory when the query is completed. There is one exception to this rule, however, and that is in memory caches
that are used by the indexing engine for various reasons.

These caches contain the indexed terms as in memory arrays and are kept outside the transction boundary. This is becuase 
creating them can be quite expensive. They are never written to disk, but they might be written to the page file. If you are 
concerned about the safety of this data, either ensure that the page file / swap are encrypted or don't index any sensitive
information. There is rarely a need to query using the full credit card number, for example. The last 4 digits are usually
sufficent. Document data that hasn't been indexes is not included in the cache, of course. 

During indexing, we also write temporary files to the indexing directory, containing the indexed data. These files are also 
encrypted using `XChaCha20Poly1305`, with a random key that is generated by RavenDB.

Even index _definitions_ are encrypted, so you can be assured that everything that is going to persistent medium is encrypted
and safe. What about what goes on the network?

### Encrypted data on the wire

Different nodes in the cluster may use different keys to encrypt the database. That means that we can't just send the raw
encrypted data from one node to the other. Indeed, whenever we send data over the network, be it as a response to a client's 
query or to replicate data to another node, we first decrypt the data, and then we send it. 

This sounds worrying, but remember that an encrypted database may only reside on a node that is running in a secured mode.
In other words, all the communication is done using HTTPS and TLS 1.2 and is both strongly encrypted and authenticated.
Let explore a few of the ways this is actually in use in practice.

Aside from a client querying the database, there are few other ways in which we can get data out of RavenDB. Replication, 
external replication and ETL are the most common ones.

Replication is for different database instance the same database group. All of them are going to be encrypted (usually, but
not always, with the same key. See Key Management section later in this chapter). External replication allows us to replicate
data to a different database, on the same cluster or on a different one. 
RavenDB requires that external replication from an encrypted database must go to a secured server, but does _not_ require that
it will be an encrypted one.

> Why doesn't RavenDB require that external replication from encrypted database will also go to an encrypted database? Because

> store in a secure location is not, which give us better performance and make certain operation tasks easier (see the 
> discusson on backups later in this chapter).

In addition to external replication, it is common to use ETL processes to get the data out of your RavenDB database. A good
example would be in a system that stores payment information. Because of PCI compliance issues, we have to store the data
in an encrypted manner. However, we also setup RavenDB ETL process to another database, to allow us to do more work on the data. 
As part of the RavenDB ETL process, we removed the sensitive payment details, so we are effectively left with just the orders
history. We aren't required to encrypt that, so there is no need to do so. In the same way, we can also use SQL ETL to transfer
some of the data to a reporting database for later analysis.

One thing to note here is that RavenDB will insist that RavenDB ETL use a secured mode (HTTPS), but we don't have a good way to
detect whatever your SQL ETL connection string is encrypted, it's the admin responsability to ensure that this communication
channel is safe from eavesdropping. 

For that matter, regardless of whatever the communication is encrypted or not, the administrators need to be aware of the data
flow inside the system and that you aren't sending sensitive information into an unencrypted store, potentially exposing data
that shouldn't be stored in plain text. 

### Key management

This section is _important_ and probably the most important aspect for an administrator to be aware of. Everything else in this
chapter describes how RavenDB works, and doesn't usually require operator attention. But in order to understand the security
of the system, you need to be aware where you keys are. 
You can encrypt your data using the strong encryption methods, using post-quantum algorithms and yet it all hinges on the 
security of your keys. If the key leaks in some fashion, this is game over as far as the security of the system is concerned.

As you can imagine, we put a lot of thought into key management. There are competing concerns here, however. The more secure
your system is, the harder it is to use. As you already seen, we didn't have to really do much when setting up the encrypted
database earlier in this chapter. We had a key generated for us by RavenDB, but aside from writing it down, we could just 
run everything normally. This leads to an interesting question, where is the key stored, and how?

In fact, there isn't _a_ key, there might be more than one. RavenDB uses the following keys^[Both the database keys and the 
server master key are local to a node, not shared across the cluster.]:

* Database encryption key - per database key used as the master encryption key for the database. These are stored in 
  the server store.
* Server master key - a server wide value that is used to encrypt the database encryption keys.

By default the server store is not encrypted, and in order to avoid an attacker simply being able to read the database 
encryption keys from the file system, we encrypt the database encryption keys with the server master key.
Of course, this just move the attack vector, so how does RavenDB protect the server master key?

We could try encrypting _that_, as well, but this will just lead us to need to encrypt the new encryption key. And if we'll
encrypt that, we'll discover that it is turtles all the way down. This isn't a problem that is unique or new to RavenDB.
Your organization is likely to have policies in place around storing encryption key. We'll discuss how RavenDB can fit into
those later on, for now, let's see how RavenDB stores the server master key by default.

On Winodws, there is the Data Protection API (`DPAPI`) which allow RavenDB to piggyback the encryption of the key on top of
the Windows password. Conceptually, Windows uses a value dervied from the logged in user's password to encrypt / decrypt 
values. This means that we don't need to have a server master key, and can rely on `DPAPI` to manage that for us.
This means that whenever we need to store the database encryption keys, we'll call `DPAPI`, which will
encrypt the key, and store this encrypted value. Whenever we open an encrypted database, we'll hand the encrypted value 
back to `DPAPI` and get the encryption key back, so we can use that to open the encrypted database.

This has the advantage of being pretty seameless and usually being good enough security. The disadvantages is that this is
tied to the Windows password. For example, an admin resetting the password will cause `DPAPI` to fail on any decrypting 
values that were encrypted with the old password (note that _changing_ the password, which requires having the old password,
is safe in this regard. It is only password reset that will cause us to lose access to previously encrypted DPAPI values).

On Linux, the situation is a lot more complex. There isn't a single solution, like `DPAPI` on Linux. Instead, there are a lot
of solutions that can be used (`libsecret`, `Gnome Keyring`, `KDE Vallet`, etc). Because there is no accepted answer, and 
as a desire to avoid dependencies that might not exists in all deployments, RavenDB doesn't make use of any of these 
solutions (see the next sectio for how you can customize that).
Instead, we use the operating system permissions to securely hold the key. This is stored in `~/.ravendb/secret.key` file
with permissions set to only allow the RavenDB user access to it. 

On Linux, if you have a single hard disk, that stores both the `secret.key` file and the encrypted database as well, you 
can plug this hard disk to a separate system, where you have `root` privileges and skip any permissions checks on the 
file system level. On Windows, there are tools such as `DPAPick` that can decrypt `DPAPI` values, given offline access to
a machine. 

So by default, RavenDB utilize the operating system level mechanisms to secure the server master key, but that can give
you only up to a certain level of security. Instead, you can customize the manner in which RavenDB get the encryption key.

#### Customizing key management in RavenDB

* Key backup
* Different keys for different servers


### Backing up encrypted databases

Snapshots (identities, compare exchange values, database record, not encrypted)
Backups - not encrypted at all
Incremental backups (never encrypted)


### Additional consdierations

* Encryption of backups !!!
