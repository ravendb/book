RavenDB is a second-generation document database, part of the NoSQL approach. That may or may not mean anything to you. In case it doesn't, here is the "elevator pitch": A document database is a database that stores "documents",  meaning structured information in the form of self-contained data (as opposed to a Word or Excel document). Usually, a document is in JSON or XML format. RavenDB is, essentially, a database for storing and working with JSON data.

RavenDB is a second-generation database because we've had time to observe what our predecessors have been doing, and thus time to learn from their mistakes. As a result, RavenDB has a number of guidelines which lead to a very different experience than is usually associated with NoSQL databases. For example, RavenDB is an ACID database, unlike many other NoSQL databases. And because we were aware of some pain points of NoSQL databases, it was designed explicitly to be easy to use and maintain.

I'm a developer at heart. That means that one of my favorite activities is writing code. Writing documentation, on the other hand, is so far down the list of my favorite activities that one could say it isn't even on the list. I do like writing blog posts, and I've been maintaining an [active blog](http://ayende.com/blog) for over a decade now.

Documentation tends to be dry and, while informative, it hardly makes for good reading (or for an interesting time writing it). RavenDB has quite a bit of documentation that tells you how to use it, what to do and why. This book isn't about providing documentation; we've got plenty of that. A blog post tells a story -- even if most of mine are technical stories. I like writing those, and I've been pleasantly surprised that a large number of people also seem to like reading them.

## What is this?

This book is effectively a book-length blog post. The main idea here is that I want to give you a way to _grok_^[Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed—to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience.  Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land] RavenDB. This means not only gaining knowledge of what it does, but also all the reasoning behind the bytes. In effect, I want you to understand all the _whys_ of RavenDB.

Since a blog post and a book have very different structure, audience and purpose, I'll instead aim to give you the same easy-reading feeling of your favorite blogger. If I've accomplished what I set out to do, this will be neither dry documentation, nor a reference book. If you need either, you can read the [online RavenDB documentation](http://ravendb.net/docs). This is not to say that the book is purely my musings; the content is also borne from the training course we've been teaching for the past five years and the formalization of our internal on-boarding training.

By the end of this book, you're going to have a far better understanding of how RavenDB is put together. More importantly, you'll have the knowledge and skills to make much more efficient use of RavenDB.

## Who is this for?

I've tried to make this book useful for a broad category of users. Developers reading this book will come away with an understanding of how to best use RavenDB features to create awesome applications. Architects will reap the knowledge required to design and guide large scale systems with RavenDB clusters at their core. The operations team will learn how to monitor, support and nurture RavenDB instances in production.

Regardless of who you are, you'll come away from this book with a greater understanding of all the moving pieces and the ability to mold RavenDB to your needs.

This book assumes that you have working knowledge of .NET and C#, though RavenDB can be used with .NET, Java, node.js, Python, Ruby and PHP. Most things discussed in the book are applicable, even if you aren't writing code in C#. If you are running on the JVM in particular (Java, Scala, Clojure and Groovy), the client API is identical to the .NET one, so even the client side knowledge is transferable.

## In this book...

One of the major challenges in writing this book came in considering how to structure it. There are so many concepts that relate to one another that it can be difficult to try to understand them in isolation. We can't talk about modeling documents before we understand the kind of features that we have available for us to work with, for example. Considering this, I'm going to introduce concepts in stages.

### Part I

[Chapter 2](#a-little-history) introduces RavenDB, non-relational document stores, and the origin story of RavenDB. If you are familiar with NoSQL databases and their history, you can skip this chapter and come back to it later.

[Chapter 3](#zero-to-60-with-ravendb-from-installation-to-usage) focuses on setting up a RavenDB server from scratch, and starts to work with the database. We discuss how to use the RavenDB Client API and what sort of infrastructure your application can use when taking advantage of RavenDB. Other topics include what RavenDB actually does with your data and storage engine choices are available. Finally, we talk briefly about running in production (which is covered in greater depth in [Part IV](#part-iv)).

[Chapter 4](#ravendb-concepts) discusses RavenDB concepts, including an introduction to entities, documents, collections, and metadata. We go over document identifiers in detail, including common strategies to generate a document ID and the implications of each. From there, we discuss etags and their use in RavenDB, including caching and optimistic concurrency control.

[Chapter 5](#advanced-client-api-usage) explores advanced client-side operations. We begin by demonstrating how we can automate common tasks via listeners and then fine-tune the serialization process. Next is a review of result streaming and bulk inserts, as the preferred ways to port a lot of data out of and into RavenDB efficiently. From there, we talk about partial document updates (patching), lazy request optimizations, change notifications and the use of result transformers.
